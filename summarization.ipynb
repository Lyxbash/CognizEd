If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination.

When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job.

       "'A P J Abdul Kalam Departing speech \\n \\n \\nFriends, I am delighted to address you all, in the country and those livi ng abroad, after \\nworking with you and completing five beautiful and eventful years in Rashtrapati \\nBhavan. Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake, the children and the members of the village participated in the reli ef operation with the \\nArmed Forces \\nbravely and were smiling when I went to meet them. They interact ed with me and said \\nthat the school was functional in the temporary tents. Here, I also witnessed the \\nparticipation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government \\nauthorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose \\nhouses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot proj ect on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. Indira Gandh i National Open \\nUniversity has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis  Ababa and \\nHarmaya Universities. As regards, tele-medicine, the special ists from CARE Hospital, Hyderabad are providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in B lack Lion \\nHospital, Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006. Using the \\nPan African network the Heads of the State in all the 53 countries  will be connected for \\ninstant communication. I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the \\nbenefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal \\ntransformation in the African continent. \\n \\nDefending the nation: Our pride \\nI visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude  held by the Indian \\nArmy, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-\\n30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to \\ngive a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being take n by different agencies to preserve it. There are also many new adventures by instituti ons and individuals. I have \\nexperienced many of them and learnt a lot about my country and our peopl e. Even while \\npursuing our economic growth, we need to do a lot to preserve the rich and diverse \\ntreasures of our culture and civilization. It is our duty for our fut ure generations. This has \\nto be done in a much larger scale through countrywide participatio n of multiple \\ninstitutions. Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable \\nprogress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly \\nthe power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given \\nme the \\nconfidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoeve r, I \\nmet they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to \\nempower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are \\non the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: \\n\"When you wish upon a star, \\nMakes no difference who you are, \\nAnything your heart desires, \\nWill come to you” \\nThis poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and i f they aim great, I am \\nsure they will reach close to the target or the target. \\n \\nMy dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of \\ndeveloped India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. \\n \\n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. \\n \\n2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate acce ss to energy and \\nquality water. \\n \\n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in sym phony. \\n \\n4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious \\ncandidates because of societal or economic discrimination. \\n \\n5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented s cholars, scientists, and \\ninvestors. \\n \\n6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all. \\n \\n7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free. \\n \\n8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiterac y removed and crimes \\nagainst women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated. \\n \\n9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy a nd continues with a \\nsustainable growth path. \\n 10. A Nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership. \\n \\nFinally let me thank each one of you for showering your love and aff ection on me \\nthroughout the last five years by your cooperation and support. \\n \\nDear Citizens, I conclude my address by sharing with you my mission in life which is to \\nbring connectivity between billion hearts and minds of the people of Indi a in our \\nmulticultural society and to embed the self confidence that \"we c an do it\". I will be \\nalways with you, dear citizens, in the great mission of making Indi a a developed nation \\nbefore 2020. \\n \\nMay God bless you. \\n \\nJai hind. \\nDr. A. P. J.

       "[Document(page_content='A P J Abdul Kalam Departing speech \\n \\n \\nFriends, I am delighted to address you all, in the country and those livi ng abroad, after \\nworking with you and completing five beautiful and eventful years in Rashtrapati \\nBhavan. Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake, the children and the members of the village participated in the reli ef operation with the \\nArmed Forces \\nbravely and were smiling when I went to meet them. They interact ed with me and said \\nthat the school was functional in the temporary tents. Here, I also witnessed the \\nparticipation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government \\nauthorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose \\nhouses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands.

Hence, India currently spearheads one of the most robust climate actions through its Nationally \\nDetermined Contributions (NDC), which includes an ambitious programme for transitions to clean energy in the world. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, the country has enhanced its climate ambition manifold.\\n The health of the farm sector is critical for the economic and social well-being of the country.

It is an industrial policy with a global vision. India now has the physical and digital infrastructure to raise the share of the manufacturing sector in the economy and make a realistic bid to be an important player in global supply chains. In the last eight years, the government has created just\\tthe\\tplatform\\tfor\\tthis\\tambition\\tto\\tbe\\tfulfilled.\\t The\\tprognosis,\\tI\\tdare\\tsay,\\tis\\tbright.\\n India’s services sector is a source of strength and is poised to gain more.

That brings us to the twelfth and last chapter of the survey. It is on infrastructure. ‘Last but not least’ is clichéd, \\nbut in this case, it is a truthful cliché. We have kept one of India’s best success stories of recent years for the last. \\nIn 2019, the Government of India adopted a forward-looking programmatic approach towards infrastructure. The National\\tInfrastructure\\t Pipeline\\twas\\tborn\\twith\\ta\\tprojected\\tinvestment\\t of\\taround\\t₹111\\tlakh\\tcrore\\tfor\\tFY20-25\\tfor\\t\\ndeveloping a comprehensive view of infrastructure development in the country.

The untapped potential is huge, and the country needs to continue to innovate. With digital technology and infrastructure, one has to keep running to hold onto one’s place. \\n The international political and economic order that emerged at the end of World War II has developed faultlines xlately, as they inevitably do if history were any guide. Consequently, envisaged as platforms for building global \\nconsensus,\\t multilateral\\t forums\\tacross\\tthe\\tboard\\tface\\texistential\\t challenges\\t today\\tand\\tneed\\thelp\\tto\\tdeliver\\ton\\ttheir\\t\\nmandates.\\t India,\\twith\\tits\\tpeaceful\\tand\\tdemocratic\\t emergence,\\t can\\tinfluence\\tthe\\tcourse\\tof\\tevents\\tand,\\tin\\tthe\\tprocess,\\t\\nfulfil\\tits\\taspiration\\tto\\tbe\\ta\\tglobal\\tpower\\tof\\trelevance.\\t It\\tis\\tbefitting\\tthat\\tduring\\tIndia’s\\t Amrit Kaal, it assumed the \\nPresidency of G-20 nations in December 2022. Global problems need global solutions, and global solutions require collaboration and cooperation. Based on the theme of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: One Earth, One Family, One Future”, India’s G20 Presidency aims to achieve co-ordinated solutions to key issues of global concern. These issues include strengthening multilateral development banks for addressing shared global challenges of the 21\\nst century, \\nmobilising\\t timely\\tand\\tadequate\\tclimate\\tfinance,\\tenhancing\\t financing\\tfor\\tpandemic\\tpreparedness,\\t managing\\tglobal\\t\\nmacroeconomic\\t vulnerabilities\\t such\\tas\\tdebt,\\tglobal\\tfood\\t&\\tenergy\\tinsecurity\\t and\\tfinancing\\turban\\tinfrastructure.\\t\\nThe Presidency is a platform for India to share its success stories with the global community, especially the manner in which Digital Public Infrastructure has supported an inclusive people-centric growth paradigm. In short, the G20 Presidency is an opportunity for India to bind an otherwise fragmented global order.\\n\\t Putting\\t the\\tEconomic\\t Survey\\tin\\tthe\\tpublic\\tdomain\\tis\\ta\\tlearning\\texperience.\\t It\\tis\\tan\\texercise\\tin\\tcogent\\tthinking,\\t\\nformulation\\t of\\tideas\\tand\\ttheir\\teffective\\tarticulation.\\t It\\tis,\\tforever,\\ta\\twork\\tin\\tprogress,\\tjust\\t like\\tthe\\teconomy.\\tWhile\\t\\nthe\\tSurvey\\tis\\tan\\tannual\\texercise,\\tthe\\tset\\tof\\tofficers\\twho\\tput\\tthis\\tdocument\\t together\\tis\\tnever\\tconstant,\\tand\\tthis\\t\\nenriches\\tthe\\tpublication\\t every\\tyear.\\tWhile\\told\\thands\\tbring\\twith\\tthem\\texperience\\t and\\texpertise,\\tnewer\\tentrants\\t\\nto\\tthe\\tdivision,\\tsuch\\tas\\tYours\\tTruly,\\tbring\\tdifferent\\tperspectives.\\t I\\tam\\tthankful\\tto\\teach\\tof\\tthem\\tfor\\tbringing\\ttheir\\t\\ninsights,\\tsubject\\texpertise\\tand\\texperience\\t into\\tthis\\tyear’s\\tSurvey.\\tI\\talso\\tthank\\tthe\\tofficers\\tof\\tvarious\\tministries,\\t\\ndepartments,\\t regulators\\tand\\tsubject\\texperts,\\twho\\tprovided\\ttimely\\tinputs\\tand\\tenhanced\\tthis\\tpublication.\\t I\\twould\\tlike\\t\\nto\\tthank\\tthe\\teditorial\\tteam\\tfor\\ttheir\\tsincere\\tefforts\\tin\\tpreparing\\tthe\\tdraft.\\t Placing\\t all\\teconomic\\tactivities\\tof\\tthe\\tcountry\\tunder\\tone\\tumbrella\\tand\\trefining\\tit\\tfrom\\tthe\\teconomists’ \\tlens\\tto\\ta\\t\\ngeneralist’s\\t perspective\\t is\\ta\\tdaunting,\\tif\\tworthwhile,\\t exercise.\\tThis\\thas\\tbeen\\ta\\tfulfilling\\tand\\tworthwhile\\t experience\\t\\nbecause it has reinforced my hope and optimism for the country and its people.

shocks in the past were severe but spaced out in time. This \\nchanged in the third decade of this millennium. At least three shocks have hit the global \\neconomy since 2020.  It all started with the pandemic-induced contraction of the global \\noutput, followed by the Russian-Ukraine conflict leading to a worldwide surge in inflation. Then, the central banks across economies led by the Federal Reserve responded with \\nsynchronised policy rate hikes to curb inflation. The rate hike by the US Fed drove capital \\ninto the US markets causing the US Dollar to appreciate against most currencies. This led to the widening of the Current Account Deficits (CAD) and increased inflationary pressures \\nin net importing economies. The rate hike and persistent inflation also led to a lowering of \\nthe global growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by the IMF in its October 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook.  The frailties of the Chinese economy further contributed to \\nweakening the growth forecasts. Slowing global growth apart from monetary tightening \\nmay also lead to a financial contagion emanating from the advanced economies where the debt of the non-financial sector has risen the most since the global financial crisis. With \\ninflation persisting in the advanced economies and the central banks hinting at further \\nrate hikes, downside risks to the global economic outlook appear elevated.\\nThe Indian economy, however, appears to have moved on after its encounter with the \\npandemic, staging a full recovery in FY22 ahead of many nations and positioning itself to \\nascend to the pre-pandemic growth path in FY23. Yet in the current year, India has also faced the challenge of reining in inflation that the European strife accentuated. Measures \\ntaken by the government and RBI, along with the easing of global commodity prices, have \\nfinally managed to bring retail inflation below the RBI upper tolerance target in November 2022. However, the challenge of the depreciating rupee, although better performing than \\nmost other currencies, persists with the likelihood of further increases in policy rates by \\nthe US Fed. The widening of the CAD may also continue as global commodity prices remain elevated and the growth momentum of the Indian economy remains strong.  The \\nloss of export stimulus is further possible as the slowing world growth and trade shrinks \\nthe global market size in the second half of the current year. \\nDespite these, agencies worldwide continue to project India as the fastest-growing major \\neconomy at 6.5-7.0 per cent in FY23. These optimistic growth forecasts stem in part \\nfrom the resilience of the Indian economy seen in the rebound of private consumption seamlessly replacing the export stimuli as the leading driver of growth.  The uptick in \\nprivate consumption has also given a boost to production activity resulting in an increase \\nin capacity utilisation across sectors. The rebound in consumption was engineered by the near-universal vaccination coverage overseen by the government that brought people 2\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nback to the streets to spend on contact-based services, such as restaurants, hotels, \\nshopping malls, and cinemas, among others. The world’ s second-largest vaccination \\ndrive involving more than 2 billion doses also served to lift consumer sentiments that may \\nprolong the rebound in consumption. Vaccinations have facilitated the return of migrant workers to cities to work in construction sites as the rebound in consumption spilled over \\ninto the housing market. This is evident in the housing market witnessing a significant \\ndecline in inventory overhang to 33 months in Q3 of FY23 from 42 months last year.\\nThe Capital Expenditure (Capex) of the central government, which increased by 63.4 per \\ncent in the first eight months of FY23, was another growth driver of the Indian economy \\nin the current year, crowding in the private Capex since the January-March quarter of 2022. On current trend, it appears that the full year’ s capital expenditure budget will be \\nmet. A sustained increase in private Capex is also imminent with the strengthening of the \\nbalance sheets of the Corporates and the consequent increase in credit financing it has been able to generate. A much-improved financial health of well-capitalised public sector \\nbanks has positioned them better to increase the credit supply. Consequently, the credit \\ngrowth to the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector has been remarkably high, over 30.6 per cent, on average during Jan-Nov 2022, supported by the extended \\nEmergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) of the Union government. The \\nincrease in the overall bank credit has also been influenced by the shift in borrower’ s funding choices from volatile bond markets, where yields have increased, and external \\ncommercial borrowings, where interest and hedging costs have increased, towards banks.  \\nIf inflation declines in FY24 and if real cost of credit does not rise, then credit growth is likely to be brisk in FY24.\\nIndia’ s economic growth in FY23 has been principally led by private consumption and \\ncapital formation. It has helped generate employment as seen in the declining urban unemployment rate and in the faster net registration in Employee Provident Fund. Still, \\nprivate capex soon needs to take up the leadership role to put job creation on a fast \\ntrack. Recovery of MSMEs is proceeding apace, as is evident in the amounts of Goods and Services Tax (GST) they pay, while the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme \\n(ECGLS) is easing their debt servicing concerns. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural \\nEmployment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been directly providing jobs in rural areas and indirectly creating opportunities for rural households to diversify their sources \\nof income generation. Schemes like PM-Kisan and PM Garib Kalyan Yojana have helped \\nin ensuring food security in the country, and their impact was also endorsed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\\n1. The results of the National Family \\nHealth Survey (NFHS) also show improvement in rural welfare indicators from FY16 \\nto FY20, covering aspects like gender, fertility rate, household amenities, and women \\nempowerment.\\nGlobal growth has been projected to decline in 2023 and is expected to remain generally \\nsubdued in the following years as well. The slowing demand will likely push down global \\ncommodity prices and improve India’ s CAD in FY24. However, a downside risk to the \\nCurrent Account Balance stems from a swift recovery driven mainly by domestic demand \\n1      https://www.undp.org/publications/addressing-cost-living-crisis-developing-countries-poverty-and-vulnerability-projections-and-policy-\\nresponses3\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\nand, to a lesser extent, by exports. The CAD needs to be closely monitored as the growth \\nmomentum of the current year spills over into the next. Growth is expected to be brisk in \\nFY24 as a vigorous credit disbursal, and capital investment cycle is expected to unfold in \\nIndia with the strengthening of the balance sheets of the corporate and banking sectors. Further support to economic growth will come from the expansion of public digital \\nplatforms and path-breaking measures such as PM GatiShakti, the National Logistics \\nPolicy, and the Production-Linked Incentive schemes to boost manufacturing output. \\nthe global economy battles through a unique set of challenges\\n1.1 In the last century, several events can be recollected that have had an adverse impact on the \\nglobal economy. The two world wars are still vivid in public memory, along with the Spanish flu \\nand the great depression. Regional conflicts have been several, as also intermittent oil shocks. The previous millennium closed with the East Asian crisis, and the new millennium in its first decade opened with the technology bust, followed several years later by the global financial crisis. The second decade, apart from minor episodes of the taper tantrum and growing trade tensions between the super-powers, had gone relatively incident-free globally, although Europe had its moments of stress during the decade. Before the third decade of the new millennium commenced, incidents of global economic turbulence were generally spaced out, allowing economies breathing time to recover before preparing for the next challenge. \\n1.2 The Covid-19 pandemic (‘pandemic’ hereinafter) notified by the WHO in January 2020 \\nwas the first challenge of the third decade that hit global growth. Two years later, as the global \\neconomy was recovering from the pandemic-induced output contraction, the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out in February 2022, triggering a swing in commodity prices and, thus, accelerating existing inflationary pressures. This posed the second challenge. Soon after, the third challenge emerged when nations undertook monetary tightening to rein in inflation causing growth to weaken. Monetary tightening also drove capital flows to safe-haven US markets, contributed to rising sovereign bond yields, and depreciation of most currencies against the US dollar. The consequent increase in borrowing costs also stressed high levels of public and private debt, threatening the financial system. Faced with the prospects of global stagflation, nations, feeling compelled to protect their respective economic space, slowed cross-border trade, which posed the fourth challenge to growth.  All along, the fifth challenge was festering as China experienced a considerable slowdown induced by its policies. The sixth medium-term challenge to growth was seen in the scarring from the pandemic brought in by the loss of education and income-earning opportunities. A simultaneous occurrence of several challenges to growth is perhaps unprecedented.  Like the rest of the world, India, too, faced this extraordinary set of challenges but withstood them better than most economies.\\n1.3 Global economic recovery was well on track until the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out \\nin February 2022. The conflict has now continued for almost a year, disrupting the restoration \\nof the supply chains disrupted earlier by lockdowns and limited trade traffic. In the last eleven months, the world economy has faced almost as many disruptions as caused by the pandemic 4\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nin two years. The conflict caused the prices of critical commodities such as crude oil, natural \\ngas, fertilisers, and wheat to soar. This strengthened the inflationary pressures that the global economic recovery had triggered, backed by massive fiscal stimuli and ultra-accommodative monetary policies undertaken to limit the output contraction in 2020. Inflation in Advanced Economies (AEs), which accounted for most of the global fiscal expansion and monetary easing, breached historical highs. Rising commodity prices also led to higher inflation in the Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), which otherwise were in the lower inflation zone by virtue of their governments undertaking a calibrated fiscal stimulus to address output contraction in 2020. \\nfigure I.1: Sharp rise in commodity prices due to the \\nRussia-Ukraine conflict; prices yet to reach pre-conflict levels \\n02004006008001000\\n0100200300400\\nApr-19\\nJun- 19\\nAug- 19\\nO ct -19\\nDe c-19\\nFeb- 20\\nApr-20\\nJun- 20\\nAug- 20\\nO ct -20\\nDe c-20\\nFeb- 21\\nApr-21\\nJun- 21\\nAug- 21\\nO ct -21\\nDe c-21\\nFeb- 22\\nApr-22\\nJun- 22\\nAug- 22\\nO ct -22\\nDe c-22\\nIndexIndex All Commodity Base Metals Crude Oil\\nFood Price Fertiliser Natural Gas Price (RHS)\\nCoal Price (RHS)\\nSource: IMF\\nInflation stays high, driven by high food and energy prices\\nfigure I.2a: advanced economies figure I.2b: emerging market economies\\n-40481216\\nFeb- 21\\nApr-21\\nJun- 21\\nAug- 21\\nO ct -21\\nDe c-21\\nFeb- 22\\nApr-22\\nJun- 22\\nAug- 22\\nO ct -22\\nDe c-22Per centEuro Area France Germany\\nUK US Ja pan\\n-505101520\\nFeb-21\\nApr-21\\nJun-21\\nAug-21\\nOct-21\\nDec-21\\nFeb-22\\nApr-22\\nJun-22\\nAug-22\\nOct-22\\nDec-22Per centBrazil China India\\nIndonesia Mexico Russia\\nSource: Bloomberg5\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\n1.4 Central banks, which were slow to react to price pressures building up during the nascent \\nrecovery from the pandemic, regarded them as transient only to realise, belatedly, the necessity \\nand the inevitability of a strong monetary policy response. Led by the US Federal Reserve, central banks have been hiking policy rates and rolling back liquidity to rein in inflation synchronously. The pace of this tightening cycle has been rapid – the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate hikes is the quickest since the inflationary episode of the 1970s, with the central bank having raised interest rates by 425 basis points since March 2022.  As the impact of monetary policy actions is felt with a lag, inflation rates remained stubbornly high during the early phase of the rate hike cycle but have begun to decline lately. At the same time, synchronised rate hikes by the central banks have not tightened financial conditions sufficiently enough for central banks to end their tightening campaign.  \\nfinancial conditions tighten\\nfigure I.3a: advanced economies figure I.3b: emerging market economies\\n949698100102104\\nDec-19\\nJun-20\\nDec-20\\nJun-21\\nDec-21\\nJun-22\\nDec-22US Japan\\n  949698100102\\nDec -19\\nJun-20\\nDec -20\\nJun-21\\nDec -21\\nJun-22\\nDec -22Euro Area UK\\n9092949698100102\\nDec-19\\nJun-20\\nDec-20\\nJun-21\\nDec-21\\nJun-22\\nDec-22Brazil Mexico\\n 92949698100102104\\nDec-19\\nJun-20\\nDec-20\\nJun-21\\nDec-21\\nJun-22\\nDec-22Indonesia India\\nSource: Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg\\nNote: All Y-axes are indices; Data is retrieved from Goldman Sachs financial condition index\\n1.5 Inflation and monetary tightening led to a hardening of bond yields across economies and \\nresulted in an outflow of equity capital from most of the economies around the world into the \\ntraditionally safe-haven market of the US. Unlike the past when the capital flight was more out of the EMEs given their relatively greater vulnerabilities, or the perception thereof, this time around, capital has also flown out from the advanced economies. The capital flight subsequently led to the strengthening of the US Dollar against other currencies – the US Dollar index strengthened by 16.1 per cent between January and September 2022. The consequent depreciation of other currencies has been widening the CAD and increasing inflationary pressures in the net importing economies.6\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nhardening of bond yields across economies\\nfigure I.4a: 10-year Bond yield in aes figure I.4b: 10-year Bond yield in emes\\n-20246\\nFeb- 21\\nApr-21\\nJun- 21\\nAug- 21\\nO ct -21\\nDe c-21\\nFeb- 22\\nApr-22\\nJun- 22\\nAug- 22\\nO ct -22\\nDe c-22Per centEuro Area France Germany\\nUK US Ja pan\\n261014\\nFeb-21\\nApr-21\\nJun-21\\nAug-21\\nOct-21\\nDec-21\\nFeb-22\\nApr-22\\nJun-22\\nAug-22\\nOct-22\\nDec-22Per centBrazil China India\\nIndonesia Mexico Russia\\nSource: Bloomberg\\nfigure I.5: the federal funds Rate was raised by a cumulative \\n425 basis points since Jan 2022 leading to capital flight from emes and aes\\n012345\\nJan-20\\nJun-20\\nNov-20\\nApr-21\\nSep-21\\nFeb-22\\nJul-22\\nDec-22Per centEffective Federal Funds Rate\\n -20 -10 0 10 20IndiaS.

The global PMI composite index has been in the contractionary zone \\nsince August 2022, while the yearly growth rates of global trade, retail sales, and industrial production have significantly declined in the second half of 2022. The consequent dampening of the global economic outlook, also compounded by expectations of a further increase in borrowing costs, was reflected in the lowering of growth forecasts by the IMF in its October 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO). 7\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\ntable I.1: Global economic challenges led to a downward  \\nrevision in growth forecast across countries\\nGrowth projections \\n(per cent)change from Weo Update \\n(July 2022) (per cent)\\n 2022 2023 2022 2023\\nWorld 3.2 2.7 0 –0.2\\nadvanced economies 2.4 1.1 –0.1 –0.3\\nUnited States 1.6 1 –0.7 0\\neuro area 3.1 0.5 0.5 –0.7\\nUK 3.6 0.3 0.4 –0.2\\nJapan 1.7 1.6 0 –0.1\\nemerging market economies 3.7 3.7 0.1 –0.2\\nchina 3.2 4.4 –0.1 –0.2\\nIndia* 6.8 6.1 –0.6 0\\nSource: IMF\\nNote: *Projection for India is for its fiscal year (Apr-Mar), while for the other economies, it is from Jan-Dec.\\nfigure I.6: Global composite pmI in \\nthe contractionary zone since august 2022figure I.7: yoy growth in retail sales, \\nindustrial production and trade falling\\n40506070\\nFeb- 21\\nApr-21\\nJun- 21\\nAug- 21\\nO ct -21\\nDe c-21\\nFeb- 22\\nApr-22\\nJun- 22\\nAug- 22\\nO ct -22\\nDe c-22IndexGlobal China US\\nEurozone Ja pan UK\\n-10010203040\\nJan-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul-21\\nSep-21\\nNov-21\\nJan-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul-22\\nSep-22Per centRetail sales\\nIndustrial production\\nTrade\\n Source: IHS Markit Source: OECD, November 2022\\n1.7 Compounding the bleak global growth outlook have been the slowdown in economic \\nactivity in China caused by the government’s zero Covid policy, a contracting real estate sector, \\nand a tepid fiscal expansion.

Non-financial sector debt of most economies has increased considerably as a percentage of GDP since Q1 of 2008 when the global financial crisis struck.  India is, however, one of the few countries whose debt burden has declined over this period, mainly because of the country’s banking sector balance sheet clean-up and the corporate sector’s deleveraging exercise undertaken during the last decade. Yet, an increase in the general government debt burden in India has attracted much attention, even as systemic risks of a financial breakdown are concentrated in other parts of the world. \\ntable I.2: core Debt of most major economies except India is higher as compared to 2008 \\ncore debt of the non-financial sector change since Q2 2008\\n(Q2 2022, % of GDp)\\nDebt/GDp \\n(avg %)household pvt non-\\nfinancialGovernment total household pvt non-\\nfinancialGovernment total\\nGlobal avg 62 160 88 248 -4 15 27 38\\naustralia 117 181 52 232 7 -9 42 33\\nBrazil 35 88 91 179 17 -36 28 66\\nmainland \\nchina62 220 74 295 43 107 47 155\\nfrance 67 231 114 345 19 71 47 118\\nGermany 56 128 67 195 -4 0.4 2 3\\nIndia 36 88 82 170 -7 -17 16 -7\\nItaly 43 113 151 264 4 -4 47 43\\nJapan 69 187 238 426 9 29 94 122\\nSouth Korea106 222 45 268 35 61 23 84\\nmexico 16 40 41 81 3 12 20 33\\nSouth africa35 67 71 138 -9 -13 45 329\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\nSpain 57 155 118 273 -26 -56 82 26\\nUK 84 150 107 257 -11 -28 62 34\\nUS 76 155 108 264 -22 -15 48 33\\nSource: BIS (based on information from their 5th December 2022 update of ‘Credit to the non-financial sector’)\\n1.9 In the devel oped world, inflationary pressures are abating but they are still on the higher \\nside historically and relative to the inflation targets that many countries have adopted. Major \\ncentral banks have reduced the pace of interest rate hikes in their latest rounds of monetary \\npolicy reviews to assess the impact thus far. Still, they have reiterated that terminal policy rates will be significantly higher than market expectations. Strong employment data and sharply lower \\nheadline inflation for December have raised hopes of the US economy achieving a softer landing. \\nSimilarly, in Europe, warmer winter weather has neutralised the risk of a near-term energy crisis. Lately, however, banks have reported much weaker earnings growth, and technology companies \\nhave begun to announce layoffs in America. Therefore, on balance, downside risk to the global \\neconomic outlook d ominates. \\nmacroeconomic and Growth challenges in the Indian economy \\n1.10 The impact of the pandemic on India was seen in a significant GDP contraction in FY21. \\nThe following year, FY22, the Indian economy started to recover despite the Omicron wave \\nof January 2022. This third wave did not affect economic activity in India as much as the \\nprevious waves of the pandemic did since its outbreak in January 2020. Mobility enabled by localised lockdowns, rapid vaccination coverage, mild symptoms and quick recovery from the \\nvirus contributed to minimising the loss of economic output in the January-March quarter of \\n2022. Consequently, output in FY22 went past its pre-pandemic level in FY20, with the Indian economy staging a full recovery ahead of many nations. The experience with the Omicron \\nvariant engendered a cautious optimism that it was possible to stay physically mobile and \\nengage in economic activities despite the pandemic.  FY23 thus opened with a firm belief that the pandemic was rapidly on the wane and that India was poised to grow at a fast pace and \\nquickly ascend to the pre-pandemic gr owth path.\\nfigure I.9: economic growth remains resilient\\n-8-404812\\n120130140150160\\nFY20 FY21(1st RE) FY22(PE) FY23(FAE)\\nPer cent₹ Lakh CroreReal GDP FY20 Level Growth (RHS)\\nSource: NSO, MoSPI\\nNote: AE stands for Advanced Estimates, PE stands for Provisional Estimates, RE stands for Revised Estimates10\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nBroad-based growth driven by Demand and Investment\\nfigure I.10a: yoy growth of Real \\nGv a  componentsfigure I.10b: Share of Real \\nGDp  components\\n-12-7-238\\nFY19 (3rd RE)\\nFY20 (2nd RE)\\nFY21 (1st RE)\\nFY22 (PE)\\nFY23 (1st AE)Per centAgriculture and allied activities\\nIndustry\\nServices\\n020406080\\nPFCE GFCF Exports of\\ngoods and\\nservicesImports of\\ngoods and\\nservicesPer cent of GDPFY19 (3rd RE) FY20 (2nd RE) FY21 (1st RE)\\nFY22 (PE) FY23 (1st AE)\\nSource: NSO, MoSPI\\nNote: AE stands for Advanced Estimates, PE stands for Provisional Estimates, RE stands for Revised Estimates\\nfigure I.11: cpI Inflation eased back \\nto RBI’s target rangefigure I.12: Indian Rupee performed \\nwell compared to other emes\\n0246810\\nFeb-21\\nApr-21\\nJun-21\\nAug-21\\nOct-21\\nDec-21\\nFeb-22\\nApr-22\\nJun-22\\nAug-22\\nOct-22\\nDec-22Per cent (YoY)CPI CPI-Food\\n-2.03.94.17.78.68.88.88.810.011.516.4\\nMexicoSouth KoreaEuroJa panUKChinaIndiaIndonesiaAustraliaBrazilSouth Africa\\nPer centDepreciation (+)/Appreciation( -) \\nagainst USD between Apr -Dec  2022\\nSource: MoSPI Source: Bloomberg, RBI (Exchange rates for December \\nas on 31st Dec 2022)\\n1.11 However, the conflict in Europe necessitated a revision in expectations for economic \\ngrowth and inflation in FY23.

For the advanced economies, in \\nparticular, the enormous fiscal stimulus earlier injected by their governments supported a strong demand revival. Growth in world trade subsequently followed, of which India was also a beneficiary. India’s exports surged in FY22, and the momentum lasted up to the first half of FY23. Export growth was strong enough to increase India’s share in the world market of merchandise exports. However, due to aggressive and synchronised monetary tightening, global economic growth has started to slow, and so has world trade. As per United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) latest global trade update, global trade growth turned negative during the H2:2022, and geopolitical frictions, persisting inflationary pressures, and subdued demand are expected to suppress global trade further in 2023. This is likely to affect many countries, including India, with the prospects of sluggish exports continuing into FY24, compared to the promise shown at the beginning of the current year. 12\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nfigure I.15: Declining shipping freight \\ncost as trade slowsfigure I.16: Share of export in GDp  \\nexpands, despite global slowdown\\n01,0002,0003,0004,000\\nMar-19\\nAug-19\\nJan-20\\nJun-20\\nNov-20\\nApr-21\\nSep-21\\nFeb-22\\nJul-22\\nDec-22Index Baltic Dry Index\\n101520253035\\nQ1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2\\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-\\n23Per cent of  Real GDPExports of goods and services\\nImports of goods and services\\nSource: The Great Eastern Shipping Co.

As these developments \\nposed downside risks to the growth of the Indian economy in FY23, many agencies worldwide have been revising their growth forecast of the Indian economy downwards. These forecasts, including the advance estimates released by the NSO, now broadly lie in the range of 6.5-7.0 per cent.  Despite the downward revision, the growth estimate for FY23 is higher than for almost all major economies and even slightly above the average growth of the Indian economy in the decade leading up to the pandemic. IMF estimates India to be one of the top two fast-growing significant economies in 2022. Despite strong global headwinds and tighter domestic monetary policy, if India is still expected to grow between 6.5 and 7.0 per cent, and that too without the advantage of a base effect, it is a reflection of India’s underlying economic resilience; of its ability to recoup, renew and re-energise the growth drivers of the economy.\\nfigure I.17: India growth projections by various agencies for fy23\\n7.3%\\n7.0% 7.0% 7.0% 7.0%\\n6.9%\\n6.8% 6.8% 6.8%\\n6.7%6.6%S&P\\nADB\\nMoody\\nFitc h\\nGoldman\\nSachs\\nWorld Bank\\nRBI\\nSBI\\nIMF\\nCitigroup\\nOECDAverage Growth= 6.9%\\nSource: Various Agencies\\nNote: ADB stands for Asian Development Bank, IMF is International Monetary Fund13\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\n1.15 India’s economic resilience can be seen in the domestic stimulus to growth seamlessly \\nreplacing the external stimuli. The growth of exports may have moderated in the second half of \\nFY23. However, their surge in FY22 and the first half of FY23 induced a shift in the gears of the production processes from mild acceleration to cruise mode. Manufacturing and investment activities consequently gained traction. By the time the growth of exports moderated, the rebound in domestic consumption had sufficiently matured to take forward the growth of India’s economy. Private Consumption as a percentage of GDP stood at 58.4 per cent in Q2 of FY23, the highest among the second quarters of all the years since 2013-14, supported by a rebound in contact-intensive services such as trade, hotel and transport, which registered sequential growth of 16 per cent in real terms in Q2 of FY23 compared to the previous quarter.\\n1.16 Although domestic consumption rebounded in many economies, the rebound in India was \\nimpressive for its scale. It contributed to a rise in domestic capacity utilisation. Domestic private \\nconsumption remains buoyant in November 2022, as indicated by Motilal Oswal’s Economic Activity Index. The index estimates that private consumption grew at a five-month high pace of 5.6 per cent YoY , driven by auto sales and broad-based expansion of services.\\n2\\nfigure I.18: enhanced capacity utilisation and business sentiments\\n6080100120140160\\n406080\\nQ1:FY19\\nQ2:FY19\\nQ3:FY19Q4:FY19\\nQ1:FY20Q2:FY20Q3:FY20\\nQ4:FY20\\nQ1:FY21\\nQ2:FY21\\nQ3:FY21\\nQ4:FY21\\nQ1:FY22\\nQ2:FY22\\nQ3:FY22\\nQ4:FY22Q1:FY23\\nQ2:FY23\\nQ3:FY23\\nIndexPer centCapa city Utilisation BEI (RHS)\\nSource: RBI\\nNote: BEI – Business Expectations Index\\n1.17 The near-universal coverage of vaccination in India overseen by the government was the \\nsingle most important reason that brought people out to the streets to re-experience the “bazaar” \\nas the marketplace was rapidly populated with service providers returning to resume business.

Since the share of consumption in \\ndisposable income is high in India, a pandemic-induced suppression of consumption built up that much greater recoil force. Hence, the consumption rebound may have lasting power. Accelerating \\ngrowth in personal loans in India testifies to an enduring release of “pent-up” demand for \\nconsumption. RBI’s most recent survey\\n3 of consumer confidence released in December 2022 pointed \\nto improving sentiment with respect to current and prospective employment and income conditions. \\n1.19 The “release of pent-up demand” was reflected in the housing market too. Demand for \\nhousing loans picked up. Consequently, housing inventories have declined, prices are firming up, \\nand construction of new dwellings is picking up pace. This has stimulated innumerable backward \\nand forward linkages that the construction sector is known to carry. The universalisation of \\nvaccination coverage also has a significant role in lifting the housing market as, in its absence, \\nthe migrant workforce could not have returned to construct new dwellings . \\n figure I.20: Growth in bank credit to housing complimenting falling household inventory\\n048121620\\nJan-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul-21\\nSep-21\\nNov-21\\nJan-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul-22\\nSep-22\\nNov-22Per centHousing Bank credit growth (YoY) \\n0204060\\n0246810\\nQ1\\nQ2Q3\\nQ4\\nQ1\\nQ2\\nQ3Q4Q1\\nQ2Q3\\nQ4Q1Q2\\nQ3FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\\nPer centLakhUnsold Inventory\\nInventory Overhang (RHS)\\nSource: RBI, PropTiger\\n3  See https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=2156915\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\n1.20 Apart from housing, construction activity, in general, has significantly risen in FY23 as the \\nmuch-enlarged capital budget (Capex) of the central government and its public sector enterprises \\nis rapidly being deployed.

Second, direct tax revenue collections have been highly buoyant, and so have GST collections, which should ensure the full expending of the Capex budget within the budgeted fiscal deficit. The growth in revenue expenditure has also been limited to pave the way for higher growth in Capex. Third, the pick-up in private sector investment since the January-March quarter of 2022. Evidence shows an increasing trend in announced projects and capex spending by the private players. Surveys of leading industry CEOs also reveal their plans and commitment to increasing Capex.\\n4  https://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?Id=15369\\n5  https://www.nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2014/02/WP_2013_125.pdf6  https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Crowding-Out-or-Crowding-In-Public-and-Private-Investment-in-India-4347016\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nfigure I.22: capex doubled in the \\npast five yearsfigure I.23: private Investment \\nremains upbeat\\n1.81.92.12.42.74.5\\n012345\\nFY18\\nFY19\\nFY20FY21\\nFY22\\nFY23₹ Lakh croreCapital Expenditure (April-November)\\n2.8\\n2.22.63.3\\n01234\\nH1FY20 H1FY21 H1FY22 H1FY23₹Lakh Crore\\nSource: CGA Source: Capitaline, Axis Bank Research\\nfigure I.24: Buoyant tax collections \\n(april-november)figure I.25: limited growth in \\nrevenue expenditure\\n5.47.8\\n5.68.1\\n4.26.77.09.4\\n8.711.9\\nDIRECT TAX GST COLLECTIONS₹ LAKH CROREFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\\n12.914.216.116.718.020.0\\n0510152025\\nFY18FY19FY20FY21FY22FY23₹ Lakh CroreRevenue Expenditure \\n(April -November)\\nSource: CGA Source: CGA\\n1.22 While an increase in export demand, rebound in consumption, and public capex have \\ncontributed to a recovery in the investment/manufacturing activities of the corporates, their \\nstronger balance sheets have also played a big part equal measure to realising their spending plans. As per the data on non-financial debt from the Bank for International Settlements, in the course of the last decade, Indian non-financial private sector debt and non-financial corporate debt as a share of GDP declined by nearly thirty percentage points. This limited the increase in interest costs, which, together with possible savings on overheads during lockdowns, contributed to the recent fortification of corporate balance sheets by higher profits. In FY22, the surge in 17\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\nexports also contributed to increasing profits in the corporate world. After-tax profits were also \\nboosted by the lower taxes announced in 2019. Better profitability helped corporates pay down debt. Consequently, not only do corporates have more scope to borrow now, but their improved financial health has also reassured their prospective lenders to expand their credit portfolios. As per Axis Bank Business and Economic Research, Capex by the Corporate sector increased to ₹3.3 lakh crore in H1 of FY23, driven by heavy investments in electricity, steel, chemicals, auto and pharmaceuticals sectors. \\n1.23 The banking sector in India has responded in equal measure to the demand for credit. \\nThe Year-on-Year growth in credit since the January-March quarter of 2022 has moved into \\ndouble-digits and is rising across most sectors. The credit growth to the MSME sector has been remarkably high, over 30.5 per cent, on average, during Jan-Nov 2022, supported by the extended ECLGS of the central government. The aggressive supply of credit by the banking sector has as much been triggered by their improved financial health as that of the corporates.  The finances of the public sector banks have seen a significant turnaround, with profits being booked at regular intervals and their Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) being fast-tracked for quicker resolution/liquidation by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). At the same time, the government has been providing adequate budgetary support for keeping the PSBs well-capitalized, ensuring that their Capital Risk-Weighted Adjusted Ratio (CRAR) remains comfortably above the threshold levels of adequacy. The successful macro stress tests performed on the banking sector further testify to its financial strength. It does help that the banking sector has negligible cross-border claims in times when currency risk is high. Nonetheless, financial strength has helped banks make up for lower debt financing provided by corporate bonds and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) so far in FY23. Rising yields on corporate bonds and higher interest/hedging costs on ECBs have made these instruments less attractive than the previous year.\\nfigure I.26: Double-digit growth in Bank credit to mSmes\\n-10010203040\\nJa n-21\\nFeb- 21\\nMar-21\\nApr-21\\nMay-21\\nJun- 21\\nJul- 21\\nAug- 21\\nSep- 21\\nO ct -21\\nNov- 21\\nDe c-21\\nJa n-22\\nFeb- 22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun- 22\\nJul- 22\\nAug- 22\\nSep- 22\\nO ct -22\\nNov- 22Per centMSMEs La rge Industry Services Non- Food Credit\\nSource: RBI18\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nfigure I.27: Declining ScB’s Gnpa  Ratio figure I.28: provisioning coverage Ratio\\n04812\\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-20 Mar-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\\n50556065707580\\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-20 Mar-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\\nSource: RBI\\nNote: SCBs stand for Scheduled Commercial Banks, PSBs stand for Public Sector Banks, PVBs stand for Private Sector Banks, FBs stands for Foreign Banks, GNPA stands for Gross Non-Performing Assets \\nfigure I.29: Rising corporate Bond yields figure I.30: moderation in private  \\nplacements of corporate Bonds\\n3.54.55.56.57.58.5\\nFeb- 21\\nApr-21\\nJun- 21\\nAug- 21\\nO ct -21\\nDe c-21Feb- 22Apr-22\\nJun- 22\\nAug- 22\\nO ct -22\\nDe c-22Per cent1 years 3 years\\n5 years 10 years\\n012345\\nFY20:H1\\nFY20:H2FY21:H1\\nFY21:H2\\nFY22:H1\\nFY22:H2\\nFY23:H1₹ Lakh crore\\nSource: Bloomberg Source: SEBI\\nfigure I.31: higher interest/hedging costs made ecBs and fccBs less attractive source of funds\\n051015202530\\nFY20:H1\\nFY20:H2\\nFY21:H1\\nFY21:H2\\nFY22:H1\\nFY22:H2\\nFY23:H1US$ Billion\\nSource: RBI19\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\n1.24 RBI has projected headline inflation at 6.8 per cent in FY23, which is outside its target \\nrange. At the same time, it is not high enough to deter private consumption and also not so \\nlow as to weaken the inducement to invest. Moderately high inflation has further ensured the anchoring of inflationary expectations preventing prices from weakening demand and growth in India. Additionally, with inflation on the declining path, the interest cost of domestic credit will likely decline, inducing a further increase in demand for credit by corporates and retail borrowers.\\nfigure I.32: Inflation expectations anchoring\\n78910111213\\nJa n-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul- 21\\nSep- 21\\nNov- 21\\nJa n-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul- 22\\nSep- 22\\nNov- 22Per centRBI\\'s Inflation Expecation Survey\\n3 months a head 1 year ahead\\n4.04.55.05.56.06.5\\nJan-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul-21\\nSep-21\\nNov-21\\nJan-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul-22\\nSep-22\\nNov-22Per centOne-year ahead Business Inflation \\nExpectation\\nSource: RBI Source: IIMA\\nIndia’s Inclusive Growth\\n1.25 Growth is inclusive when it creates jobs. Both official and unofficial sources confirm \\nthat employment levels have risen in the current financial year. The Periodic Labour Force \\nSurvey (PLFS) shows that the urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above declined from 9.8 per cent in the quarter ending September 2021 to 7.2 per cent one year later (quarter ending September 2022). This is accompanied by an improvement in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) as well, confirming the emergence of the economy out of the pandemic-induced slowdown early in FY23. Job creation appears to have moved into a higher orbit with the initial surge in exports, a strong release of the “pent-up” demand, and a swift rollout of the capex. Since export growth is plateauing and the “pent-up” release of demand will have a finite life, it is essential that capex continues to grow to facilitate employment in the economy, at least until such time the global economy rebounds and, through the export channel, provides an additional window to India for job creation. Thankfully, the private sector has all the necessary pre-conditions lined up to step up to the plate and do the capex heavy lifting. Their internal resource generation is good, capacity utilisation is high, and the demand outlook continues to improve. Capital markets are willing to finance new investments, as are financial institutions.\\u2003\\n1.26 In FY21, the Government announced the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme. The \\nscheme has succeeded in shielding micro, small and medium enterprises from financial distress. \\nA recent CIBIL report (ECLGS Insights, August 2022) showed that the scheme has supported MSMEs in facing the covid shock, with 83 per cent of the borrowers that availed of the ECLGS 20\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nbeing micro-enterprises. Among these micro units, more than half had an overall exposure of \\nless than ₹10 lakh. Furthermore, CIBIL data also shows that ECLGS borrowers had lower non-performing asset rates than enterprises that were eligible for ECLGS but did not avail of it. Further, the GST paid by MSMEs after declining in FY21 has been rising since and now has crossed the pre-pandemic level of FY20, reflecting the financial resilience of small businesses and the effectiveness of the pre-emptive government intervention targeted towards MSMEs.\\nfigure I.33: Urban Unemployment Rate at four-year low\\n8.920.9\\n7.2\\n0510152025\\nJun-19\\nSep-19\\nDec-19\\nMar-20\\nJun-20\\nSep-20\\nDec-20Mar-21\\nJun-21\\nSep-21\\nDec-21\\nMar-22\\nJun-22\\nSep-22Per cent\\nSource: NSO, MoSPI\\nfigure I.34: GSt  paid by mSmes in fy22 \\ncrossed the pre-pandemic levelfigure I.35: eclGS aided mSmes in \\nimproving their asset quality\\n0123456\\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22₹ Lakh CroreMicro Medium Small\\n4.6%5.0%4.7%6.6%\\n6.0%\\n5.5%\\nMicro Small MediumPer cent  of BalancesNPA Rate as on March 2022\\nAvailed ECLGS Eligible  but did not avail ECLGS\\nSource: Ministry of Finance\\nNote: Includes firms with turnover up to ₹1000 crore.

The share of this category rose to about 60 per cent in FY22, indicating that MGNREGA, besides generating daily wage employment, has also been creating assets for individual households to diversify their sources of income 21\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\nand lift their supplementary incomes. Details on asset creation under MGNREGA are further \\ndiscussed in Chapters 6  “Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent”. In addition, schemes like PM-KISAN, which benefits households covering half the rural population, and PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana have significantly contributed to lessening impoverishment in the country. The UNDP Report of July 2022  stated that the recent inflationary episode in India would have a low poverty impact due to well-targeted support. In addition, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) in India shows improved rural welfare indicators from FY16 to FY20, covering aspects like gender, fertility rate, household amenities, and women empowerment. \\nfigure I.36: Improvement in Rural Welfare Indicators \\n38.4\\n2135.8 35.5\\n19.332.1\\nPropor tion of children who are stunted\\n(height for age)Proportion of children who are wasted\\n(weight for height)Propor tion of children who are\\nunderweight (weight for age)NFHS-4 (FY16) NFHS-5 (FY21)\\nSource: NFHS-4 and NFHS-5\\n1.28 The year FY23 so far for India has reinforced the country’s belief in its economic \\nresilience. The economy has withstood the challenge of mitigating external imbalances caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict without losing growth momentum in the process. India’s stock markets had a positive return in CY22, unfazed by withdrawals by foreign portfolio investors. India’s inflation rate did not creep too far above its tolerance range compared to several advanced nations and regions. A relatively higher growth forecast among major economies, projected retail inflation only slightly higher than the tolerance limit, and an estimated current account deficit financeable with normal capital inflows and forex reserves large enough to finance close to a year’s imports are clear evidence of economic resilience amidst a global polycrisis. Strong consumption rebound, robust revenue collections, sustained capex in both the public and the private sector, growing employment levels in the urban as well as the rural areas, and targeted social security measures further underpin the prospects for economic and social stability and sustained growth. India is the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms and the fifth-largest in market exchange rates. As expected of a nation of this size, the Indian economy in FY23 has nearly “recouped” what was lost, “renewed” what had paused, and “re-energised” what had slowed during the pandemic and since the conflict in Europe.   \\noutlook: 2023-24\\n1.29 India’s recovery from the pandemic was relatively quick, and growth in the upcoming year \\nwill be supported by solid domestic demand and a pickup in capital investment. The current 22\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\ngrowth trajectory will be supported by multiple structural changes that have been implemented \\nover the past few years. The private sector – financial and non-financial – was repairing balance sheets, which led to a slowdown in capital formation in the previous decade. The financial system stress experienced in the second decade of the millennium, evidenced by rising non-performing assets, low credit growth and declining growth rates of capital formation, caused by excessive lending witnessed in the first decade-plus, is now behind us. Aided by healthy financials, incipient signs of a new private sector capital formation cycle are visible.  More importantly, compensating for the private sector’s caution in capital expenditure, the government raised capital expenditure substantially. Budgeted capital expenditure rose 2.7X in the last seven years, from FY16 to FY23, re-invigorating the Capex cycle. Structural reforms such as the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code enhanced the efficiency and transparency of the economy and ensured financial discipline and better compliance. \\nfigure I.37: Slowdown in global economic growth and trade \\n-8-404812\\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023FPer centReal GDP Growth WTO\\'s Trade Volume Growth\\nSource: IMF, WTO\\nNote: F stands for Forcast\\n1.30 Even as India’s outlook remains bright, global economic prospects for the next year have \\nbeen weighed down by the combination of a unique set of challenges expected to impart a few \\ndownside risks. Multi-decadal high inflation numbers have compelled central banks across the globe to tighten financial conditions. The impact of monetary tightening is beginning to show in slowing economic activity, especially in Advanced Economies. Besides this, adverse spillovers from the prolonged strains in supply chains and heightened uncertainty due to geo-political conflict have further deteriorated the global outlook. Hence, global growth is forecasted to slow from 3.2 per cent in 2022 to 2.7 per cent in 2023 as per IMF’s World Economic Outlook, October 2022. A slower growth in economic output coupled with increased uncertainty will dampen trade growth. This is seen in the lower forecast for growth in global trade by the World Trade Organisation, from 3.5 per cent in 2022 to 1.0 per cent in 2023.\\n1.31 On the external front, risks to the current account balance stem from multiple sources. \\nWhile commodity prices have retreated from record highs, they are still above pre-conflict \\nlevels. Strong domestic demand amidst high commodity prices will raise India’s total import 23\\nState of the Economy 2022-23: Recovery Complete\\nbill and contribute to unfavourable developments in the current account balance. These may be \\nexacerbated by plateauing export growth on account of slackening global demand. Should the current account deficit widen further, the currency may come under depreciation pressure.\\n1.32 Another risk to the outlook originates from the ongoing monetary tightening exercise. \\nWhile the pace of rate hikes has slowed, major central banks have reaffirmed their hawkish stance \\non inflation. Entrenched inflation may prolong the tightening cycle, and therefore, borrowing costs may stay ‘higher for longer’. In such a scenario, global economy may be characterised by low growth in FY24. However, the scenario of subdued global growth presents two silver linings – oil prices will stay low, and India’s CAD will be better than currently projected. The overall external situation will remain manageable. \\n1.33 The upside to India’s growth outlook arises from (i) limited health and economic fallout \\nfor the rest of the world from the current surge in Covid-19 infections in China and, therefore, \\ncontinued normalisation of supply chains; (ii) inflationary impulses from the reopening of China’s economy turning out to be neither significant nor persistent; (iii)  recessionary tendencies in major AEs triggering a cessation of monetary tightening and a return of capital flows to India amidst a stable domestic inflation rate below 6 per cent; and (iv) this leading to an improvement in animal spirits and providing further impetus to private sector investment. \\n1.34 Against this backdrop, the survey projects a baseline GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in real \\nterms in FY24. The projection is broadly comparable to the estimates provided by multilateral \\nagencies such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the ADB and by RBI, domestically. The actual outcome for real GDP growth will probably lie in the range of 6.0 per cent to 6.8 per cent, depending on the trajectory of economic and political developments globally.\\n******CHAPTER02\\n2014-2022 is an important period in the economic history of India. The economy underwent \\na gamut of wide-ranging structural and governance reforms that strengthened the \\neconomy’ s fundamentals by enhancing its overall efficiency. With an underlying emphasis \\non improving the ease of living and doing business, the reforms were based on the broad principles of creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with \\nthe private sector for development, and improving agricultural productivity. Under normal \\ncircumstances, reforms of such scale and relevance would have accelerated economic growth. However, largely due to the balance sheet stress caused by the credit boom in \\nthe previous years and secondarily due to the one-off global shocks that followed, key \\nmacroeconomic variables such as credit growth, capital formation, and hence economic growth were adversely impacted during this period. Further, some reforms deliver results \\nwith lagged effects as their diffusion in the economy takes time.\\nThis situation is analogous to the period 1998-2002 when transformative reforms undertaken \\nby the government had lagged growth returns due to temporary shocks in the economy. Once \\nthese shocks faded, the structural reforms paid growth dividends from 2003. Similarly, in \\nthe present decade, the presence of strong medium-term growth magnets gives us optimism and hope that once these global shocks of the pandemic and the spike in commodity prices \\nin 2022 fade away, the Indian economy is well placed to grow faster in the coming decade. \\nWith improved and healthier balance sheets of the banking, non-banking and corporate sectors, a fresh credit cycle has already begun, evident from the double-digit growth in \\nbank credit over the past months. Additionally, the economy has started benefiting from \\nthe efficiency gains resulting from greater formalisation, higher financial inclusion, and economic opportunities created by digital technology-based economic reforms. Thus, India’ s \\ngrowth outlook seems better than in the pre-pandemic years, and the Indian economy is \\nprepared to grow at its potential in the medium term. \\nIntroduction\\n2.1 Indian economy has undergone a transformative process of New Age reforms in the \\nlast eight years. These diverse policies converge towards improving the economy’s overall \\nefficiency and lifting its potential growth. To achieve the broader policy goal of unleashing the productive potential of the economy and its people, the reforms aimed at enhancing the ease of living and doing business at the fundamental level. The use of technology, in particular digital technology, undergirds the reforms. The economic energy and positive mindset that the reforms unleashed would have led to a sharp acceleration in growth but for the balance sheet repair of IndIa\\'s MedIuM -TerM  \\nGrowTh ouTlook: wITh \\nopTIMIsM  and hope25\\nIndia\\'s Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope\\nthe over-leveraged domestic financial sector (banking & non-banking) and the corporate sector \\nand secondarily to the one-off global shocks that followed.  \\n2.2 With the impetus of the persistent structural and governance reforms introduced in the \\ncountry and strong macroeconomic stability, it is essential to get a handle on the medium-term \\ngrowth outlook for India. Will the economy achieve and sustain a steady growth rate once the one-off shocks recede? This chapter attempts to answer this question and concludes that the chances of India growing at its potential and for the potential growth itself to be lifted are higher than it has been in the last two decades. The chapter starts with a brief discussion of the history of India’s product and capital market reforms over the previous three decades. It further delves into the overarching philosophy behind the landmark reforms undertaken from 2014 to 2022 and elaborates on the shocks faced by the Indian economy during this period. It concludes with a discussion on the medium-term growth magnets for India. \\nproduct and Capital Market reforms\\nInitiation of the reforms- 1991\\n2.3 The macroeconomic imbalances of the late 1980s and early 1990s pushed the government \\ntowards introducing the structural reforms of 1991. The high combined deficit of the central and state governments, elevated inflationary pressures, and large and unsustainable current account deficit (CAD) led to a balance of payments crisis in the Indian economy.\\n1 In response \\nto the situation, trade and investments were liberalised in 1991. Import licensing on almost all intermediate inputs and capital goods was done away with, and the entry restrictions for firms were simplified. The new policy encouraged the entry of private sector firms by ending the public sector monopoly in many sectors and initiating the automatic approval policy for FDI up to 51 per cent. The exchange rate was made flexible and allowed to depreciate as necessary to maintain competitiveness. The rupee was made fully convertible on the current account and partially on the capital account. These reforms had a positive effect on the economy. The real growth went up from an average of 5.5 per cent during the 1980s to 6.3 per cent from FY93 to FY2000. Trade liberalisation had a visible effect on external trade as the total goods and services trade to GDP rose from 17.2 per cent in 1990 to 30.6 per cent in 2000.\\n2\\nContinuity in reforms with a renewed Impetus\\n2.4 The product and capital market reforms continued slowly over the decade of the 1990s. \\nThey got a renewed impetus from the government closer to the decade’s end. Investments were liberalised further to encourage Foreign Direct Investment as a main source of non-debt-creating capital inflows (Figure II.1). The telecom sector was entirely reformed by the New Telecom Policy 1999. It was opened for private sector participation with a strengthened regulatory regime (TRAI). The reforms separated the licensing and policy functions of the government from that of an operator (BSNL). These reforms were a cornerstone for the IT sector boom in India and had widespread spillover benefits to other sectors of the economy. The policy on disinvestment and privatisation also gathered steam during this period. The government set up a dedicated Ministry to take this agenda forward. It sold equity stakes in some CPSEs and privatised companies such as Maruti Udyog, Hindustan Zinc, Bharat Aluminum, and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited. \\n1\\u2003History of Reserve bank of India-V olume IV (https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/RHvol-4.aspx)\\n2\\u2003Arvind Panagariya, 2004. “India in the 1980’s and 1990’s: A Triumph of Reforms,”IMF Working Papers2004/043, International Monetary Fund.

The project brought significant economic benefits to the country \\nthrough enhanced connectivity, improved industrial activity, trade, and economic growth.3 \\nAlongside this, structural policies were formulated to address the macroeconomic imbalances. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act was passed to address the historic highs of the combined Gross fiscal deficit of the Government (Figure II.2). The banking system, which had accumulated bad debts during the period of economic resurgence after the 1991 reforms, was supported through the deregulation of interest rates and the enactment of the SARFAESI Act 2002. Interest rates were deregulated to promote competition amongst banks, provide more banking options to depositors, and strengthen monetary policy transmission.\\n4 The \\nSARFAESI Act allowed banks and financial institutions to recover their dues by proceeding against the secured assets of the borrower/guarantor without the intervention of the court/tribunals.\\n5 Both these reforms improved the credit situation in the economy (Figure II.3).\\nFigure II.2: Gross Fiscal deficit (centre and \\nstates combined) (% of Gdp)Figure II.3: Growth in non-Food Credit by \\nscheduled Commercial Banks\\nPost \\nFRBM\\n024681012\\nFY88\\nFY90\\nFY92\\nFY94\\nFY96\\nFY98\\nFY00\\nFY02FY04\\nFY06\\nFY08Per cent of GDP\\n05101520253035\\nFY97\\nFY00\\nFY03\\nFY06\\nFY09\\nFY12\\nFY15\\nFY18\\nFY21Per cent\\nSource: RBI Source: RBI\\n3\\u2003 Ghani, Ejaz & Grover, Arti & Kerr, William.

The sanctions imposed by the US on India after India’s nuclear \\ntest led to a sharp decline in capital flows to India during the months following the nuclear tests (Figure II.4)\\n6. The period between 2000 and 2002 also witnessed two successive droughts (Table \\nII.1). These domestic shocks were accompanied by heightened global uncertainties resulting from the end of a tech boom and the 9/11 attacks (Figure II.5). Moreover, the balance sheets of the Indian financial system and corporate sector were under-repair during the period. Though all these factors overshadowed the immediate impact of reforms undertaken by the government then, they laid the groundwork and prepared the Indian economy structurally to participate in the Global boom which followed soon after. \\nFigure II.4: Monthly Foreign direct \\nInvestment came down (1998)Figure II.5: Trends in the nasdaQ \\nComposite index (dot-Com Bubble crisis)\\n0100200300400500\\nApr-97\\nJun-97\\nAug-97\\nOct-97\\nDec-97\\nFeb-98\\nApr-98\\nJun-98\\nAug-98US$ million\\n 0100020003000400050006000\\nJan-98\\nJul-98\\nJan-99\\nJul-99\\nJan-00\\nJul-00\\nJan-01\\nJul-01\\nJan-02\\nJul-02\\nSource: RBI Source: FRED\\nTable II.1: occurrence, number of people affected and damages \\nof droughts in  India between 2000 and 2002\\ndate location numbers\\nApr 2000Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, \\nOrissa, MaharashtraAffected- 9 crore; Damage-US$588,000,000\\nNov 2000Mahasamund, Raipur, Kawardha, Rajnandgaon, Durg districts (Chhattisgarh region)\\nMay 2001 New Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Orissa 20 deaths\\nJul 2002Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, \\nDelhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Nagaland, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, \\nHimachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, \\nTamil NaduAffected-30 crore; \\nDamage- US$910,721,000\\nSource: Samra, J.

The years of structural reforms had prepared the Indian economy to \\ncontribute to global growth and also benefit from it. While the global growth averaged 4.8 per cent during 2003-2008, the Indian economy grew at more than 8 per cent on average. The economic growth during the period was supported by strong capital inflows (Figure II.1), which indicated favourable domestic and external factors. Some of these included sustained momentum in domestic economic activity, better corporate performance, a conducive investment climate, positive sentiments for India as a preferred investment destination, and encouraging global liquidity conditions/ interest rates.\\n7  This combination of structural economic reforms with their \\nlagged effect on economic growth has parallels to what is unfolding in the Indian economy presently. \\nreforms for new India-sabka saath sabka Vikaas\\n2.8 The reforms undertaken before 2014 primarily catered to product and capital market space. \\nThey were necessary and continued post-2014 as well. The government, however, imparted a new dimension to these reforms in the last eight years. With an underlying emphasis on enhancing the ease of living and doing business and improving economic efficiency, the reforms are well placed to lift the economy’s potential growth. The broad principles behind the reforms were creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sector for development, and improving agricultural productivity (Figure II.6). This approach reflects a paradigm shift in the growth and development strategy of the government, with the emphasis shifted towards building partnerships amongst various stakeholders in the development process, where each contributes to and reaps the development benefits ( Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas).\\nFigure II.6: underlying framework for reforms for a new India\\nenhancing productive potential of economy and its people\\nEfficient resource allocation\\nCreating public goods\\nTrust-based \\ngovernanceAgricultural  \\nproductivity\\nPrivate sector \\nparticipationease of doing \\nbusiness + ease of \\nliving\\n2.9 While the reforms undertaken in the post-2014 period have multiple socioeconomic \\nbenefits for the economy, this chapter focuses on the growth-centric aspects of these reforms. \\n7\\u2003 Mohan, Rakesh, (2008), Capital flows to India, p. 235-263 in Settlements, Bank for International eds., Financial globalisation and emerging \\nmarket capital flows, vol. 44, Bank for International Settlements, (https://www .bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap44m.pdf)29\\nIndia\\'s Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope\\nThe forthcoming section discusses how each of the principles that anchor the new reform \\nframework contributes to enhancing the productive potential of the economy and its people.

A quantum leap in policy commitment and outlay for infrastructure is now visible in the last few years (Figure II.7), cushioning economic growth when the non-financial corporate sector was unable to invest due to balance sheet troubles. In doing so, the government has laid a good platform for crowding in private investments and growth in the coming decade. \\n8\\nFigure: II.7: union government’s capital expenditure as a per cent of Gdp  on the rise \\n1.01.52.02.53.03.5\\n012345678\\nFY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22\\nPAFY23\\nBE\\nPer cent Rs lakh crore \\nCentre\\'s Capital Expenditure as a per cent of GDP (RHS) Centre\\'s Capital Expenditure (Rs lakh crore)\\nSource: RBI, MoSPI, O/o CGA\\n2.11 The dedicated programs for road connectivity (Bharatmala), port infrastructure \\n(Sagarmala), electrification, railways upgradation, and operationalising new airports/ air \\nroutes (UDAN) have significantly improved the physical infrastructure in the last few years (Figure II.8). The details on the upgradation of physical infrastructure may be seen in Chapter 12. With the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) in 2019 and the National Monetization Pipeline in 2021, a strong baseline for infrastructure creation and development has been put in place, providing a multitude of opportunities for foreign investment and engagement. The NIP was launched with 6,835 infrastructure projects with a projected infrastructure investment of  \\n₹111 lakh crore. This has expanded to over 9,000 projects across 35 sub-sectors and covers economic and social infrastructure projects jointly funded by the Central Government, State Governments, and the private sector. With its strong forward and backward linkages, physical infrastructure will enhance the economy’s productivity in the medium term.\\n8\\u2003 ‘Crowding-Out or Crowding-In?

A recently published article9 in the RBI’s \\nMonthly Bulletin estimates that India’s core digital economy has grown at 2.4 times the overall economic growth between 2014 and 2019. With its strong forward linkages to the non-digital \\nsectors,  digitalisation strengthens potential economic growth through various channels. Some of these, such as higher financial inclusion, greater formalisation, increased efficiencies and \\nenhanced opportunities, are discussed below.\\n2.13 Based on the pillars of a digital identity Aadhar, linking bank accounts with PM-Jan \\nDhan Yojana, and the penetration of mobile phones (JAM Trinity), the country has witnessed \\nsignificant progress in financial inclusion in recent years. The population covered with bank \\naccounts increased from 53 per cent in 2015-16 to 78 per cent in 2019-21 (as per NFHS). International evidence shows that countries at the same level of development have taken almost \\nhalf a century to achieve the extent of India’s massive expansion in access to bank accounts \\n(D’Silva et al. 2019)\\n10. Numerous digital public goods such as digital verification (e-KYC), \\ndigital signature, digital repositories (Digilocker), and digital payments (UPI) have supported \\nfinancial inclusion by improving access to formal financial services and reducing transaction \\ncosts. 11 Greater financial inclusion and access to credit incentivise higher consumption and \\ninvestment, leading to higher economic growth. Some of the recently introduced digital \\ninitiatives, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and Account Aggregator \\nframework, will open up further avenues for e-commerce market access and credit availability for smaller businesses and strengthen the expected economic growth in the medium term. \\n9\\u2003 Dhirendra Gajbhiye et al.

A report in The Economist (January 2023) attributes the trends of formalisation of the \\nworkforce in India to the transformed digital financial architecture, the digitalised GST system and growth in the usage of UPI.\\n12 The creation of digital identities such as Aadhar, registration \\nof unorganised workers on the eshram portal, street vendors on SV ANidhi, taxpaying firms on GSTN, and MSMEs on the Udayam portal, has played a significant role in the inclusion of these groups under the formal economic net. As an illustration, we can now track that out of the 1.27 crore enterprises registered on the Udyam Portal, more than 93,000 micro-enterprises have grown to become small enterprises, and 10,000 small enterprises have become medium enterprises over the last two years. \\n13 Creating an identity has also simplified and enabled access \\nto formal credit for many of these groups. More than 32.7 lakh street vendors have availed of a first loan of ₹10,000 under the PM SV ANidhi Scheme, and of these, more than 6.9 lakh have availed a second loan of ₹20,000. Moreover, digital systems such as the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) and e-Way Bill system have enabled the formalisation of business transactions. The increasing number of GST taxpayers, from 70 lakh in 2017\\n14 to more than 1.4 crore in \\n2022, indicates the expansion in formal businesses. Formalisation of transactions, for even the smallest of amounts, has been possible with the wide usage of the digital payment system of UPI. The greater formalisation will enhance the productivity of individuals and businesses in the economy through improved access to credit and efficiency gains in their operations.\\n2.15 Gains from economic and structural reforms tend to be more significant when the binding \\nconstraints of governance have been addressed.\\n15  Unified digital interfaces that connect various \\ninitiatives/portals have simplified governance resulting in a more efficient resource allocation \\nin the economy. The National Single Window System for business approvals, the JanSamarth portal for credit-linked Central Government scheme, and the UMANG app for access to Central and state government services are essential steps towards enhancing the ease of doing business through the integration of existing systems. Eshram portal, with more than 28.5 crore registered workers, has been integrated with various other digital portals for easy accessibility. PM Gatishakti, the GIS-based platform that brings together multiple ministries for integrated \\nplanning and coordinated implementation of multimodal infrastructure connectivity projects, aims to reduce logistics costs. Thus, digitaltechnologies being at the forefront of the reforms provide a unique opportunity to accelerate India’s economic growth. More details on the strides in digital infrastructure may be seen in chapter 12.\\nII. Trust-based Governance\\n2.16 Building trust between the government and the citizens/businesses unleashes efficiency \\ngains through improved investor sentiment, better ease of doing business, and more effective governance. Consistent reforms have been made in this direction during the last eight years. Simplification of regulatory frameworks through reforms such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and the Real Estate(Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) have enhanced the ease of doing business. The IBC has imbibed some of the best international practices of an asset \\n12\\u2003 ‘Imagine an India without hawkers’, The Economist January 2023.

It provides an honourable exit mechanism for honest business failures \\nand enables the release of credit locked into the stressed assets for better resource allocation. This market-driven, transparent resolution mechanism instils confidence in the financial system and attracts many new investors to invest in Indian businesses.\\n16 A significant achievement of \\nthe IBC has been the change brought in the debtor-creditor relationship. Debtors are resolving stress early to avoid being pushed into insolvency. Until 30 September 2022, 23,417 applications for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of corporate debtors having underlying defaults of ₹7.3 lakh crore were disposed of before their admission into CIRP .\\n 17 \\n2.17 The other regulatory reform, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), is \\ncreating a culture of transparent transactions in the real estate sector.18 The Act has transformed \\nthe real estate sector by registering real estate brokers and agents with the regulator, establishing mechanisms for the speedy redressal of disputes and enabling a single window clearance for timely approvals to the developers. The Real Estate Regulatory Authorities across the country have disposed off more than 1.06 lakh complaints. With 99262 projects and 71514 agents already registered under RERA, the Act incentivises more investments into the sector.\\n2.18 Another significant reform to enhance doing business has been the decriminalisation of \\nminor economic offences under the Companies Act of 2013 (Table II.2). By introducing civil \\nliabilities for dealing with simple defaults that do not involve fraud or where the nature of the lapse is purely procedural, the government has demonstrated its intent to promote ease of doing business for domestic and global investors. Furthermore, a trust-based approach towards compliance builds entrepreneurs’ faith in corporate institutions and motivates them to adopt fairer and more transparent business practices. After the reform, more than 1400 default cases have been decided without resorting to the court.

These efforts have improved investor sentiments and strengthened the growth potential.\\n2.20 In particular, the taxation ecosystem in the country has undergone substantial reforms in \\nthe post-2014 period. Tax policy reforms such as adopting a unified GST, reducing corporate \\ntax rates, exemption of sovereign wealth funds and pension funds from taxes, and removing the Dividend Distribution tax have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses; and have removed the distortionary incentives from the economy. GST, for instance, has helped businesses by reducing compliances, ensuring a free flow of goods across states, doing away with the need for businesses to have a separate warehouse for every state, and hence improving the ease of doing business. The earlier indirect tax regime was origin based, and it distorted the location choices of the businesses. \\n2.21 Despite tax rationalisation, a positive trend of higher tax buoyancy is visible in the \\neconomy. The notable economist Indira Rajaraman termed GST ‘a revenue success’ in 2019\\n20; \\nthereafter, the positive GST revenue collection trends have strengthened further despite the \\npandemic. The average monthly gross GST collection has increased from ₹0.90 lakh crore in FY18 to ₹1.49 lakh crore in FY23 (Figure II.9). Evidence suggests that the buoyancy of the indirect tax system replaced by GST has improved in the post-GST regime (Box III.1, Chapter 3). Since other tax reforms, such as the corporate tax cut, were followed by the pandemic-led uncertainty and disruptions, their impact on collections is gradually becoming visible in higher tax collections. The Corporate tax collections for April to November 2022 have increased by 21.1 per cent on a YoY basis compared to a longer-term average YoY growth of 10.3 per cent during the corresponding period from FY13 to FY19. \\nFigure II.9: rising average monthly gross GsT collection\\n0.900.981.02\\n0.951.241.49\\n0.60.70.80.91.01.11.21.31.41.51.6\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23₹ lakh crore\\nSource: Department of Revenue\\n20\\u2003 Monograph titled ‘The evolving GST’ delivered by Indira Rajaraman as the Chelliah Memorial Lecture at the Madras School of Economics \\nin 2019. (https://www.mse.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Monograph-43.pdf )34\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n2.22 One prominent reason behind the higher revenue buoyancy is the introduction of \\ntechnology-backed tax governance reforms for simplifying tax processes, enhancing compliance, \\nand improving fraud detection systems. The faceless assessment and appeal systems no longer require a physical interface between taxpayers and the Income Tax department. Moreover, multiple consistency checks possible with integrated digital systems reduce tax evasion. As an illustration, the GST return filing mechanism results in better income reporting, leading to higher direct tax collections. In this regard, the decision to share data and information between CBDT and CBIC on an automatic and regular basis is a promising reform, and it would result in efficiency gains in the tax system. These reforms augur well for future economic growth and future resource mobilisation in the economy.\\nIII. promoting the private sector as a co-partner in the development\\n2.23 A fundamental principle behind the government’s policy in the post- 2014 period has \\nbeen the engagement with the private sector as a partner in the development process. The government’s disinvestment policy has been revived in the last eight years with stake sales and the successful listing of PSEs on the stock market. During FY15 to FY23 (as of 18 January 2023), an amount of about ₹4.07 lakh crore has been realised as proceeds from disinvestment through 154 transactions using various modes/instruments. The privatisation of Air India was particularly significant for re-igniting the privatisation drive. Evidence shows that privatisation has improved labour productivity and the overall efficiency of the PSUs disinvested during 1990-2015.\\n21  The New Public Sector Enterprise Policy for Aatmanirbhar Bharat has thus been \\nintroduced to realise higher efficiency gains by minimising the presence of the government in the PSEs to only a few strategic sectors. \\n2.24 Significant initiatives have been introduced under Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India \\nprogrammes to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities and exports across the industries. Sector-\\nspecific Production Linked incentives (PLI) have been introduced in the aftermath of the pandemic to incentivise domestic and foreign investments and to develop global Champions in the manufacturing industry. The PLI scheme will significantly boost production, exports and employment in the medium term; however, its impact will be visible only with time. Early estimates of the impact of PLI show encouraging trends in some sectors. The PLI scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing has attracted an investment of ₹4,784 crore and contributed to a total production of ₹2.04 lakh crore, including exports of ₹80,769 crore (as of September 2022)\\n22. The need for a dedicated government \\npolicy to support domestic industrialisation amidst foreign competition can be better appreciated from the industrialisation experiences of East Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan in 1960-1990. These countries supported their domestic industries during their high growth phase, while also ensuring healthy competition required for the industries to grow.\\n 23  \\n2.25 Production incentives under Aatmanirbhar Bharat also incentivise foreign investments for \\ndomestic production. The last eight years have seen further liberalisation of the policy towards foreign investors, with most sectors now open for 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under the automatic route. This has resulted in a visible structural shift in the gross FDI flows to India \\n21\\u2003 Chhibber, Ajay & Gupta, Swati, 2017. “Bolder Disinvestment or Better Performance Contracts?

The National Logistics Policy (2022)24 has been launched to create an overarching \\nlogistics ecosystem for lowering the cost of logistics and bringing it to par with other developed \\ncountries. This would boost economic growth, provide employment opportunities, and make Indian products more competitive in the global market. Moreover, opening the strategic sectors, such as defence, mining and space, for the private sector has enhanced the business opportunities in the economy. Investment incentives and easing business compliances have created an ecosystem for the start-ups to nurture. The number of recognised Start-ups has increased from 452 in 2016 to 84,012 in 2022. More details on reforms for industries may be seen in Chapter 9.\\n2.27 Reforms to address the structural challenges faced by MSMEs have been a vital part of \\nthe industrial policy in recent years. Support measures for MSMEs during the pandemic in the \\nform of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and revision in the definition of MSMEs under the ambit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat helped them face the crisis shock. The ECLGS, in particular, has in the last two years benefited 1.14 crore MSMEs, which have availed collateral-free loans amounting to ₹2.38 lakh crore. Further measures, such as the introduction of TReDS to address the delayed payments for MSMEs, the inclusion of Retail and Wholesale trades as MSMEs, and the extension of non-tax benefits for three years in case of an upward change in the status of MSMEs, have created a resilient support system for the MSME sector to grow. The MSMEs have also benefitted from access to digital platforms for their marketing needs and easy payments. With the Open Network for Digital Commerce creating opportunities for MSMEs to access e-commerce technology and diversify their target markets, this trend will likely strengthen further. Moreover, onboarding GSTN as a Financial information provider \\n24\\u2003Details in Chapter 1236\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\non the Account aggregator platform will open up avenues for access to credit for MSMEs. \\nEnhancing opportunities and productivity of the MSME sector have large-scale implications for a resilient production ecosystem, thus strengthening the growth prospects of the industry and the economy as a whole. These reforms, therefore, must continue. \\nIV . enhancing productivity in agriculture\\n2.28 The agriculture sector in India has grown at an average annual growth rate of 4.6 per cent \\nduring the last six years. This growth is partly attributable to good monsoon years and partly to the various reforms undertaken by the government to enhance agricultural productivity. Policies such as Soil Health Cards, the Micro irrigation Fund, and organic and natural farming have helped the farmers optimise resource use and reduce the cultivation cost. The promotion of Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) extension Platform have empowered farmers, enhanced their resources, and enabled them to get good returns. Agri Infrastructure Fund (AIF) has supported the creation of various agriculture infrastructures. Kisan Rail exclusively caters to the movement of perishable Agri Horti commodities. Cluster Development Programme (CDP) has promoted integrated and market-led development for horticulture clusters. Support for creating a Start-up ecosystem in agriculture and allied sectors is also being provided to the farmers. All these measures are directed towards supporting the growth in agricultural productivity and sustaining its contribution to overall economic growth in the medium term.\\nreturns to the economic and structural reforms after 2014\\nshocks that the economy faced during 2014-22\\n2.29 Under normal circumstances, comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms undertaken in the \\neconomy during the last eight years (as covered in the previous section) would have accelerated India’s growth. But that was not to be. The ‘culprit’ is India’s balance sheet stress caused by the credit boom in previous years. As per data from the Bank for International Settlements, India’s non-financial private sector debt to GDP ratio went up from 72.9 per cent in March 2004 to 113.6 per cent by December 2010. That is an increase of 40.7 percentage points in just over six years. In rupee terms, the amount of debt accumulated by the non-financial sector went up from nearly 44 lakh crore to almost 133 lakh crore. It trebled in six years. Despite limited economic reforms, global capital flows and optimism about BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) triggered a domestic credit and investment boom that eventually proved unsustainable, as the twin deficit – fiscal and external - crisis of 2013 revealed. Thereafter the non-financial private sector debt to GDP ratio began to come down meaningfully only from 2015 onwards, dropping to a low of 83.8 per cent by December 2018. That is nearly a 30 percentage point reduction from 113.6 per cent in December 2010 over eight years. \\n2.30 Unsurprisingly, the credit to the private non-financial sector as a per cent of GDP was \\nconsistently below its trend value for most of the second decade of the millennium, implying a negative credit gap to GDP ratio (Figure II.11). The gap worsened to an unprecedented level of 25 per cent in 2017. A statistically significant negative correlation (-0.5) between the Gross NPAs and credit growth shows that the banks’ credit supply was severely constrained due to stress in their balance sheet during the second decade.\\n25 That explains the large negative deviation of the \\ncredit-to-GDP ratio from its trend.\\n25\\u2003 Muduli, S. and Behera, H., 2021.

Hence, banks’ non-performing assets began to rise. That set in motion a long period of repair of the financial and non-financial sector balance sheets in the second half of the last decade. The government and the RBI took several policy initiatives to help the financial sector recoup the balance sheet stress during the 2010s. Some of these such as the amendment to the SARFAESI Act 2002, implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), launch of ‘Asset Quality Review’ (AQR), introduction of prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, recapitalisation of Public Sector Banks (PSB), and merger of PSBs among others, helped in cleaning up the balance sheets of banks/corporates. \\n2.32 Even as the balance sheets of banks and companies began to mend and improve, came the \\ncollapse of the Infrastructure Finance and Leasing Services (IL&FS) in September 2018. It was \\na big non-banking financial company (NBFC) with a huge asset base. Its collapse also had a huge ripple effect on other non-banking financial entities. Few housing finance companies went under as well. Hence, housing loan disbursements were disrupted. Usually, non-banking finance companies lend to more borrowers and riskier borrowers than banks. They are refinanced by banks. Their re-financings came down in the wake of the collapse of IL&FS, a big NBFC, followed by the collapse of some housing finance companies. Therefore, bank credit growth came down to single digits towards the end of 2019, continuing into 2020. Low credit growth and hence weaker capital formation impacted economic growth. \\n2.33 The government responded with several measures to stem the fallout of the collapse of \\nIL&FS and housing finance companies, including a corporate tax cut in September 2019. Soon \\nthereafter, the pandemic struck, and the government had to address the emerging health, social and economic consequences of unprecedented nature. These have been discussed in detail in the previous two economic surveys of 2020-21 and 2021-22. These back-to-back shocks have delayed the impact of such momentous reforms on the economic growth.38\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nThe period 2014-2022 is analogous to the period 1998-2002 \\n2.34 India’s recent economic history provides a similar parallel to this situation. During 1998-\\n2002, transformative reforms were launched but yielded lagged growth dividends (Table II.3). \\nThis phenomenon was attributed to a series of one-off shocks resulting from external factors and the domestic financial sector clean-up, which overshadowed the growth returns from 1998 to 2002\\n26. By 2003, when the shocks dissipated, India participated in the global boom and grew \\nat a higher rate. Similarly, in the present context, as the global shocks of the pandemic and the spike in commodity prices in 2022 fade away, the Indian economy is well placed to grow at its potential in the coming decade.\\nTable II.3: a parallel between the periods: 1998-2002 and 2014-2022\\n1998-2002 2014-2022\\nshocks to the economy\\n\\uf077\\tNuclear device testing 1998; sanctions \\nfollowed\\uf077\\tPeriod of Banking, Non-Banking and Non-Financial Corporate Sector Balance-sheet \\nstress\\n\\uf077\\tBanking and Corporate Sector deleveraging and repairing balance-sheets\\uf077\\tUnprecedented pandemic shock followed by inflation global commodity price shock \\nfollowed by tightening of financial conditions\\uf077\\tTwo successive droughts\\n\\uf077\\tTechnology bust; US recession and 09/11\\nstructural reforms in the economy\\n\\uf077\\tInterest rate deregulation\\n\\uf077\\tPrivatisation\\n\\uf077\\tAsset Recovery for banks\\n\\uf077\\tInfrastructure (Golden quadrilateral) \\n\\uf077\\tFRBM Act \\uf077\\tUnique Identity\\n\\uf077\\tFinancial Inclusion\\n\\uf077\\tGST leading to formalisation\\n\\uf077\\tInsolvency & Bankruptcy Code\\n\\uf077\\tPrivatisation\\n\\uf077\\tTax rates rationalisation and tax administration \\nreforms\\n\\uf077\\tDecriminalisation of offences\\n\\uf077\\tVaccines roll-out\\n\\uf077\\tExpenditure Management Reforms\\n\\uf077\\tAatmaNirbhar Bharat\\n\\uf077\\tPublic Digital Infrastructure\\nGrowth returns\\n\\uf077\\tOne-off shocks delayed the growth returns \\uf077\\tBalance sheets strengthened in the financial \\nsector; the corporate sector deleveraged by about 30 percentage points (Non-financial \\nprivate sector debt to GDP ratio)\\n\\uf077\\tOnce shocks faded away, structural reforms \\npaid growth dividends from 2003 onwards• Emphasis on macro-economic stability while \\ndealing with global shocks\\n26\\u2003Refer Paragraph 6 of this chapter for details39\\nIndia\\'s Medium-Term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope\\nGrowth Magnets in this decade (2023-2030)\\nIndia is prepared to grow at its potential once the one-off shocks recede\\n2.35 After a long period of balance sheet repair in the financial and corporate sector, the financial \\ncycle is poised to turn upward. As the health and economic shocks of the pandemic and the spike \\nin commodity prices in 2022 wear off, the Indian economy is thus well placed to grow at its potential in the coming decade, similar to the growth experience of the economy after 2003. This is the primary reason for expecting India’s growth outlook to be better than it was in the pre-pandemic years. The sound and healthy financial system developed over the last few years will ensure efficient credit provisioning, contributing to higher growth in the coming years through higher investments and consumption. Thanks to India’s digital revolution and formalisation, banks have far more information about their customer’s credit risks than before, thus being able to make credit and pricing decisions better than before. That should make for a healthier and longer credit cycle than before. Bank credit growth has been well into double-digits for quite some time now. A recent IMF Working paper\\n27 analyses the trends in the Credit-\\nto-GDP ratio gap28, bank balance sheets and the GDP growth in India since 2012; and shows that \\nbetter-capitalised banks result in higher credit growth, which further translates into higher GDP growth. \\n2.36 The digitalisation reforms and the resulting efficiency gains in terms of greater \\nformalisation, higher financial inclusion, and more economic opportunities will be the second \\nmost important driver of India’s economic growth in the medium term. In its recent Article IV report for India, IMF highlighted that India’s successful implementation of the wide-ranging reforms and more than expected dividends from digitalisation could increase India’s medium-term growth potential.\\n 29 These productivity-enhancing reforms along with the Government\\'s \\nSkilling initiatives, will also help unleash the benefits of the demographic dividend in the coming years. In sum, various initiatives undertaken in the last eight years have bolstered India’s growth potential, and it will be reflected in actual GDP growth as the effects of one-off the shocks recede.\\n2.37 The evolving geo-political situation also presents an opportunity for India to benefit from \\nthe diversification of global supply chains. The last few years have exposed multinational firms \\nto unprecedented risks due to global trade tensions, pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, and the conflict in Europe. Firms were exposed to the risk of concentrating their production in a single country. Therefore, given the global policy uncertainty, multinational firms are gradually exploring strategies to diversify their production bases and supply chains. UNCTAD, in one of its reports, shows that ‘reshoring, diversification, and regionalisation will drive the restructuring of global value chains in the coming years’.\\n30 With enabling policy frameworks, \\nIndia presents itself as a credible destination for capital diversifying out of other countries.31 32 \\n27\\u2003 IMF Working paper (WP/22/137)- Financial Sector and Economic Growth in India by Margaux MacDonald;TengTeng Xu (July 2022) – \\n(https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Financial-Sector-and-Economic-Growth-in-India-520580)\\n28\\u2003Difference between actual ratio and its trend value29\\u2003  https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2022/12/21/India-2022-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-State-\\nment-by-the-527283 \\n30\\u2003 UNCTAD World Investment report 2020 (https://unctad.org/news/covid-19-will-likely-transform-global-production-says-un-report; https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/wir2020_en.pdf)\\n31\\u2003 ‘Helped by PLI scheme, Apple’s India exports set to hit Rs 20,000 crore’, Business Standard, December 2022 (https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/helped-by-pli-scheme-apple-s-iphone-exports-from-india-hit-record-122121200940_1.html)\\n32\\u2003‘ India to get more Apple suppliers as iPhone production picks up: Experts’, Business Standard, December 2022 (https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/india-to-get-more-apple-suppliers-as-iphone-production-picks-up-experts-122121900505_1.html)40\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nThe recently published Chief Economists Outlook 2023 (World Economic Forum) highlights \\nIndia’s opportunity to gain from these global trends of supply chain diversification.33\\n2.38 While the new age reforms undertaken over the last eight years form the foundation of \\na resilient, partnership-based governance ecosystem and restore the ability of the economy to grow healthily, further reforms are needed to ensure that economic growth can both accelerate and be sustained at higher levels, to deliver a better quality of life. The deregulation and simplification of compliances should continue to dismantle the licensing, inspection and compliance regime entirely. State governments have to address power sector issues, and the financial viability concerns of the Discoms have to be addressed. Impetus must be given to education and skilling to match the requirements of modern industry and technologies, deal with twenty-first-century challenges such as climate change and energy transition, and make the most of India’s demographic dividend. Initiatives to sensitise the population towards a healthy lifestyle should be continued. Strategies to arrest and reverse the rising obesity levels should be adopted.\\n34 Long-range plans need to be formulated to secure the necessary metals and minerals \\nrequired for energy transition and diversification. Determined efforts should be taken to make the public sector asset monetisation scheme successful in realising wide-ranging efficiency gains from the programme. If asset monetisation revenues are used to reduce public sector debt, the sovereign credit rating will improve, leading to a lower cost of capital. That will be the biggest fiscal stimulus to the economy. Reforms to reduce the compliance burden on MSMEs, enhance their access to finance and working capital and equip them with skills, knowledge and attitude to grow their businesses responsibly must continue. State governments should make conclusive progress on the various factor market reforms in different stages of completion. \\n2.39 In this chapter, we have shown that the Indian economy had not lost its vigour, nor have \\ngovernment reform measures their effectiveness. The Indian economy could have grown faster \\nin the absence of the financial and corporate sector balance sheet stress. Even as we were looking forward to the economy being able to reap the benefits of improved and healthier balance sheets in the new decade, it was buffeted by the global pandemic followed by a sharp rise in the prices of food, fuel and fertiliser. Negative shocks will and do fade, as they did in the early years of the new millennium. Now, financial and corporate sector balance sheets are in good shape, and there is a willingness to borrow and lend. Hence, it is inevitable that the effects of these reforms will now shine through. A restored credit cycle will rejuvenate the Indian private sector capex cycle. That alone is adequate to enable India to grow at least 6 per cent per annum in real terms. On top of that, the higher economic efficiency resulting from the public digital infrastructure created over the last 6-7 years will also add 30- 50 basis points to the potential GDP growth. The growth effects of the maturation of India’s public digital infrastructure are insufficiently understood. Formalisation and financial inclusion that it has enabled are too evident to be ignored. It is a matter of time before its growth effects become persistent in the data. That is why we are optimistic that India will achieve an average of 6.5 per cent real GDP growth in the medium term. In addition, if the other reforms explained in the previous paragraph are pursued in the coming years, India’s potential GDP growth can rise to 7-8 per cent per annum in the medium term.\\n33\\u2003Chief Economists Outlook 2023 (World economic Forum)- https://www.weforum.org/reports/chief-economists-outlook-jan-2023 \\n34\\u2003As per National Family Health Survey 5, Obesity is rising for both men and women across all states .CHAPTER03\\nFiscal Developments: \\nRevenue Relish\\nThe Union Budget for FY23 was presented in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. \\nSoon after its presentation, the geopolitical conflict aggravated global supply disruptions \\nand adversely impacted the prices of fuel, food, and other essential commodities. The \\nGovernment of India\\'s fiscal policy response to the crisis comprised of a judicious mix of increasing food and fertiliser subsidies on the one hand and a reduction in taxes on \\nfuel and certain imported products on the other. Despite these additional fiscal pressures \\nduring the year, the Union Government is on track to achieve the budget estimate for the fiscal deficit in FY23. The resilience in the fiscal performance of the Union Government \\nhas been facilitated by the recovery in economic activity, buoyancy in revenues from \\ndirect taxes and GST, and realistic assumptions in the Budget. The Gross Tax Revenue registered a YoY growth of 15.5 per cent from April to November 2022, driven by robust \\ngrowth in the direct taxes and Goods and Services Tax (GST). The growth in direct taxes \\nduring the first eight months of the year was much higher than their corresponding longer-term averages. The GST has stabilised as a vital revenue source for central and \\nstate governments, with the gross GST collections increasing at 24.8 per cent on YoY basis \\nduring April - December 2022. \\nOn the expenditure side, the Union Government\\'s emphasis on capital expenditure \\n(Capex) has continued despite higher revenue expenditure requirements during the year. \\nThe Centre\\'s Capex has steadily increased from a long-term average of 1.7 per cent of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5 per cent of GDP in FY22 P A. The Centre has also incentivised \\nthe State Governments through interest-free loans and enhanced borrowing ceilings to \\nprioritise their spending on Capex. With an emphasis on infrastructure-intensive sectors like roads and highways, railways, and housing and urban affairs, the increase in Capex \\nhas large-scale positive implications for medium-term growth. This Capex-led growth \\nstrategy will enable India to keep the growth-interest rate differential positive, leading to a sustainable government debt to GDP in the medium run. 42\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nintroduction\\n3.1 With the continuing global risks and uncertainties, the availability of fiscal space with \\ngovernments has become paramount. It is especially true following the recent incidence of the \\npandemic when the fiscal policy became an effective macroeconomic stabilisation tool globally. In India, particularly when all economic activities had reached a standstill, fiscal policy was instrumental in providing a safety net to the vulnerable, reviving the economy by boosting demand, and addressing certain domestic supply-side constraints through public investments and sustained structural reforms.\\n3.2 The large, frontloaded packages across the countries led to over-stimulation of demand, \\nleading to its much faster recovery. In combination with the still-existing supply disruptions and \\nconstraints, the overheating of the economy led to inflationary pressures. The conflict in Europe and the related geopolitical developments aggravated the crisis. The slowing global growth, rising interest rates, persistently high inflation rates and uncertain global environment have thus posed certain pertinent questions for fiscal-policy experts to motivate the overarching fiscal policy strategy. How to evaluate the trade-off between maintaining fiscal support to manage the continuing crisis versus withdrawing fiscal stimulus from the economy to control inflation and regain the lost fiscal space? When to do so and at what pace? While a sudden withdrawal may have costs for medium-term growth, a slow withdrawal may be inflationary and hence put upward pressure on yields, making the debt costly. Moreover, the financial markets may have less tolerance for fiscal unorthodoxy in an era of rising interest rates\\n1. \\n3.3 Against this backdrop, the Government of India adopted a calibrated fiscal response to the \\npandemic and planned to withdraw the fiscal stimulus gradually as it moves along the glide path outlined in the Budget FY22. This chapter discusses the government\\'s fiscal strategy amidst uncertain geopolitical developments. The chapter starts with a discussion of the performance of the Union Government\\'s finances, followed by an overview of the State finances. It concludes with a commentary on India\\'s debt profile.\\nDevelopments in union Government finances\\n3.4 While India entered the pandemic with a stretched fiscal position, the government\\'s \\nprudent and calibrated fiscal response enabled stable public finances even amidst the present uncertainties. The fiscal deficit of the Union Government, which reached 9.2 per cent of GDP during the pandemic year FY21, has moderated to 6.7 per cent of GDP in FY22 PA and is further budgeted to reach 6.4 per cent of GDP in FY23 (Figure III.1). This gradual decline in the Union government\\'s fiscal deficit as a per cent of GDP, in line with the fiscal glide path envisioned by the government, is a result of careful fiscal management supported by buoyant revenue collection over the last two years.\\n1‘Ruchir Sharma’s investor guide to 2023: from peak dollar to better TV’, Financial Times, 6th January 2023 (https://www.ft.com/con -\\ntent/3e040c2c-f7e4-4121-9dfe-7ba5732707f7)43\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nFigure iii.1: trends in union government \\ndeficits over the years- On the way to fiscal \\nconsolidationFigure III.2: Government on track to achieve \\nthe Fiscal deficit target for FY23\\n104.6\\n46.258.9\\nApr- Nov\\n(5 year Avg)Apr- Nov\\n2021Apr- Nov\\n2022As a per cent of BE3.53.44.79.2\\n6.76.4\\n0.40.41.65.7\\n3.32.8\\n0246810\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22\\nPAFY23\\nBEPer cent of GDP\\n Fiscal Deficit  Primary Deficit\\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA        Source: O/o CGA  \\nUnion Government on track to achieve the Fiscal deficit target for FY23\\n3.5 The Union Budget for FY23 was presented in a recovering yet uncertain macroeconomic \\nenvironment, not anticipating the geopolitical developments that unfolded during the year. As the \\nconflict in Europe broke out early in the year, it aggravated supply disruptions and had an adverse impact on the prices of fuel, food, and other essential commodities. The government\\'s fiscal policy response necessitated additional spending on food and fertiliser subsidies, accompanied by specific duty cuts to control the pass-through of the high imported prices to the consumers/users. Despite additional fiscal resource pressures during the year, the Union Government is well on track to achieve the budget estimate for the fiscal deficit in FY23. The fiscal deficit of the Union Government at the end of November 2022 stood at 58.9 per cent of the BE, lower than the five-year moving average of 104.6 per cent of BE during the same period (Figure III.2).\\nConservative budget assumptions provide a buffer during global uncertainties.\\n3.6 This resilience in the fiscal performance of the Centre has resulted due to a recovery in \\neconomic activity, buoyancy in revenues observed during the year, and conservative assumptions of macroeconomic variables in the Budget. The prudent assumptions in Budget FY23 provided a buffer to the government during global uncertainties. As an illustration, the Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) to the Centre was envisaged to grow at 9.6 per cent in FY23 BE relative to FY22 RE. However, given the higher \\'Provisional Actual\\' figures recorded for the GTR relative to the Revised estimates in FY22, the growth in GTR of FY23 BE turns out to be a mere 1.8 per cent over FY22 PA. Against this implicit (budgeted) growth, the data of the first eight months of the year show that GTR has grown at a much higher rate (Table III.1). The annual estimate of GTR for FY23 is thus expected to overshoot the budget estimates.44\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nTable: III.1: Stable performance of the Union Government fiscal indicators from April to \\nnovember 2022\\n₹ lakh crore as a per cent of Be YoY growth (per cent)\\nBE FY23Apr-Nov \\n2021Apr-Nov \\n2022Apr-Nov \\n2021Apr-Nov \\n20225 yr Avg \\nApr-Nov Apr-Nov \\n2021Apr-Nov \\n2022\\nRevenue Receipts 22.04 13.58 14.23 75.9 64.6 12.3 67.1 4.8\\nGross tax revenue 27.58 15.42 17.81 69.5 64.6 13.9 50.3 15.5\\nAssignment to \\nStates8.17 4.03 5.51 60.5 67.5 16.6 20.4 36.8\\nTax Revenue (net to Centre)19.35 11.35 12.25 73.5 63.3 12.9 64.9 7.9\\nNon-Tax Revenue 2.70 2.23 1.98 91.8 73.5 13.3 79.5 -11.1\\nNon-Debt Capital Receipts 0.79 0.21 0.41 11.0 52.3 30.6 14.1 100.4\\nNon-Debt receipts 22.84 13.79 14.65 69.8 64.1 12.2 66.0 6.2\\nTotal Expenditure 39.45 20.75 24.43 59.6 61.9 11.4 8.8 17.7\\nRevenue Expenditure31.95 18.01 19.96 61.5 62.5 11.4 8.2 10.8\\nCapital   Expenditure7.50 2.74 4.47 49.4 59.6 12.9 13.5 63.4\\nRevenue Deficit 9.90 4.43 5.73 38.8 57.8 11.4 -48.1 29.3\\nFiscal Deficit 16.61 6.96 9.78 46.2 58.9 11.5 -35.3 40.6\\nPrimary Deficit 7.21 2.34 4.33 33.5 60.1 13.1 -66.2 85.1\\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA \\nPerformance of Union Government Non-debt Receipts\\n3.7 The Union government\\'s non-debt receipts comprise revenue receipts (tax and non-tax) \\nand non-debt capital receipts.

This revenue revival was attributed to a rebound in the collection of all major direct and indirect taxes (except excise duties) in FY22.

The Gross Tax Revenue registered a YoY growth of 15.5 per cent from April to November 2022, and the Net Tax Revenue to the Centre after the assignment to states grew by 7.9 per cent on a YoY basis (Table III.1, III.2). 45\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nTable: III.2: Buoyant Union Government taxes from April to November 2022\\nIn ₹ lakh crore as a per cent of Be YoY growth (per cent)\\nBE FY23Apr-Nov \\n2021Apr-Nov \\n2022Apr-Nov \\n2021Apr-Nov \\n2022Apr-Nov \\n2021Apr-Nov \\n2022\\nGross Tax Revenue, of \\nwhich27.58 15.42 17.81 69.5 64.6 50.3 15.5\\nDirect taxes 14.20 7.00 8.67 63.1 61.0 66.3 23.9\\na.

However, that revenues have grown at a pace much higher than the \\ngrowth in GDP is a testimony to the effectiveness of efforts taken by the government to expand the tax base and enhance tax compliance. Structural reforms like the introduction of GST and the digitalisation of economic transactions have led to the greater formalisation of the economy and hence expanded the tax net. Other tax administration/policy measures, such as the Faceless Assessment and Appeal, simplification of return filing, assistance to taxpayers in getting familiar with the systems, generation of e-way bills under the GST system, and information sharing between government departments among others, have nudged higher tax compliance through technology and artificial intelligence. Details may be seen in Annexe 2 and 3.\\nDirect taxes propelling the growth in Gross tax revenue\\n3.10 Direct taxes, which broadly constitute half of the Gross Tax Revenue (Figure III.3), have \\nregistered a YoY growth of 26 per cent from April to November 2022, enabled by corporate and personal income tax growth. The growth rates observed in the major direct taxes during the first eight months of FY23 were much higher than their corresponding longer-term averages  \\n(Figure III.4).46\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure III.3: Composition of tax profile of  \\nUnion Government (FY23 BE)Figure III.4: Growth in Centre\\'s direct taxes  \\nare higher than their corresponding longer-term \\naverages during the period April to November\\n15.523.9\\n21.126.7\\n13.9 12.910.316.8\\nGTR Direct\\ntaxesCIT PIT\\nAvg FY13-FY19 (Apr-Nov) Apr-Nov 2022\\nSource: Union Budget FY23, O/o CGA\\nNote: GTR -  Gross Tax Revenue,  GST - Goods and Services Tax, CIT - Corporation Income Tax, PIT - Taxes on Income other than Corporation Income Tax.m UED - Union Excise Duties\\nCustoms and Excise duties act as Flexi-fiscal policy tools\\n3.11 While direct taxes have safeguarded the revenue buoyancy, indirect taxes such as customs \\nand excise duties have acted as flexible policy tools during the fiscal response to the pandemic. \\nWhen the collection of direct and indirect taxes was adversely impacted during the pandemic year FY21, and low global oil prices created some elbow room for raising taxes on petroleum, the government raised the excise duty on petrol and diesel to augment the revenue pool. Subsequently, when other taxes recovered and inflationary pressures built up in the economy, the government reduced the excise duty in November 2021 and May 2022 to control the pass-through of the rising global oil prices on the consumers. The budget estimate had factored in negative growth of 15 per cent on excise collections for FY23. In line with the expectation, the excise duty collection has declined by 20.9 per cent from April to November 2022 on a YoY basis.\\n3.12 Given the rise in prices of essential imported products during FY23, customs duties were \\nbrought down on several items to control the inflation impact on edible oils, pulses, cotton, steel, \\netc. However, high imports during the current year have led to a 12.4 per cent YoY growth in the customs collection from April to November 2022 (Table III.2), which is higher than the average growth during the corresponding period from FY13 to FY19.\\nStabilising Goods and Services Tax yielding returns\\n3.13 The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has evolved and stabilised as a vital revenue source \\nfor central and state governments (may refer Box III.1). Their gross GST collections, taken together, were ₹13.40 lakh crore from April to December 2022. Thus, implying a YoY growth of 24.8 per cent (Figure III.5). The pick-up in GST collections was consistently spread across all the months during the current fiscal year, with an average monthly collection of ₹1.5 lakh crore (Figure III.6). The improvement in GST collections has been due to the combined effect of the Customs\\n8%\\nGST\\n28%\\nCIT\\n26%PIT\\n26%UED\\n12%47\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nrapid economic recovery post-pandemic, the nationwide drive against GST evaders and fake \\nbills along with many systemic changes introduced recently, and various rate rationalisation measures undertaken by the GST Council to correct inverted duty structure. Consistent efforts have resulted in a doubling of the GST net, with the number of GST taxpayers increasing from nearly 70 lakh in 2017\\n2 to more than 1.4 crore in 2022. Apart from directly supporting \\ngovernment revenues, GST has led to better reporting of income, which in turn has positive externalities for income tax collection and economic activity.\\n4.3\\n-14.137.7\\n24.8\\n-20-1001020304050\\n2019 2020 2021 2022Per centFigure III.5: High YoY growth in  \\ncumulative Gross Gst  collections  \\nfrom april to December\\nSource: Department of Revenue202020212022\\n0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.8\\nJan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\nMay\\nJun\\nJul\\nAug\\nSep\\nOct\\nNov\\nDecRs lakh croreFigure iii.6: continued momentum in  \\nmonthly Gross GST collections  \\nover the years\\nSource: Department of Revenue\\nBox III.1: Maturing system of indirect tax collections\\nHas the shift to GST improved or worsened the buoyancy of India\\'s indirect tax system? This box \\nattempts an analysis to shed light on this question.\\nThe aggregate State and Central taxes subsumed in the GST exhibited a CAGR of 11.53 per cent in \\nthe pre-GST period (FY13 to FY17). The nominal GDP grew at a CAGR of 11.54 per cent during this \\nperiod (see items 1 to 7 of Table 1A). Since the growth of the subsumed taxes was marginally less than \\nthe growth of GDP, the buoyancy was just below one and could be taken as one for practical purposes. \\nThe post-GST period experienced many headwinds, most notably the exogenous shock of the Covid \\npandemic. The nominal GDP grew at a slower CAGR of 9.6 per cent in the post-GST years (FY19 to FY23). However, GST collections have grown at a CAGR of 10.9 per cent (see items 8 to 10 of Table \\n1B), implying aggregate GST collections buoyancy of around 1.1. This has occurred even though \\nthe effective GST rate has fallen from inception (from 14.4 per cent in 2017 to 11.6 per cent in 2019, \\naccording to RBI).\\n2PMEAC Report- ‘GST-Connecting the remaining dots’, June 202248\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nImproved tax collection efficiency was one of the main arguments in favour of GST.

Budget FY23 envisaged a lower collection of non-tax revenue receipts during the current year relative to FY22 (around 22.5 per cent lower than FY22 PA) (Table III.3).

During FY15 to FY23 (as of 18 January 2023), an amount of about ₹4.07 lakh crore has been realised as proceeds from disinvestment through 154 transactions using various modes/instruments.

Nevertheless, the government has reaffirmed its commitment towards privatisation and strategic disinvestment of Public Sector Enterprises by implementing the New Public Sector Enterprise Policy and Asset Monetisation Strategy.

The government adopted a pragmatic approach of increasing its expenditure in a calibrated way. Upon ensuring the basic safety nets for the vulnerable, the emphasis of the Government expenditure shifted to productive domestic capital expenditure. In the subsequent year, FY22, the total Union Government expenditure was brought down to 16 per cent of GDP (PA), and a more significant proportion of this accrued to capital expenditure (Figure III.8). The capital expenditure by the Centre has steadily increased from a long-term average of 1.7 per cent of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5 per cent of GDP in FY22 PA. It is further budgeted to increase to 2.9 per cent of GDP in FY23. (Figure III.7). This highlights an improvement in the quality of Government expenditure over the years.\\nFigure III.7: Increasing Union Government capital expenditure to GDP ratio \\n2.2%2.5%2.9%\\n1.0%1.5%2.0%2.5%3.0%\\nFY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\\nBE\\n Source: Previous Economic Surveys, Union Budget documents, O/o CGA\\n12.3%13.3%\\n12.5%12.1%15.6%19.0%\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22\\nPAFY23\\nBEFigure III.8: Rising share of Capital \\nExpenditure in Total Expenditure of the Union \\nGovernment\\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA \\n29.3%\\n4.0%11.7% 12.8% 13.5%63.4%\\nF Y 1 8F Y 1 9F Y 2 0F Y 2 1F Y 2 2F Y 2 3Figure III.9: High growth in capital expenditure \\nof the Union Government during the April-\\nnovember period\\nSource: O/o CGA51\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nCapex-led growth to bring back animal spirits and manage debt levels\\n3.18 In absolute terms, the Government of India had budgeted an unprecedented ₹7.5 lakh \\ncrore of Capital Expenditure for FY23, of which more than 59.6 per cent has been spent from \\nApril to November 2022.

While on the one hand, capital expenditure strengthens aggregate demand and crowds-in private spending in times of risk aversion; it also enhances the longer-term supply-side productive capacity. With early signs of a rebound in private sector investments in recent months, capital expenditure has played its role (details in chapter 1). To push for enhancing Capex from all directions, the Centre announced several incentives to boost states\\' capital expenditure in the form of long-term interest-free loans and capex-linked additional borrowing provisions.\\nTable III.4:  Centre\\'s Capital expenditure focussed on infra-related sectors\\nBE FY23 April-Nov 2022 April-Nov 2021 YoY growth\\n₹ lakh crore (Per cent)\\nRoad Transport and Highways 1.88 1.49* 0.74 102.10\\nRailways 1.37 1.15 0.65 76.65\\nDefence Services (capital outlay) 1.52 0.73 0.73 0.88\\nTransfer to States 1.12 0.43 0.08 438.54\\nTelecommunications 0.54 0.25 0.03 692.43\\nHousing and Urban Affairs 0.27 0.11 0.17 -32.47\\nAtomic Energy 0.14 0.09 0.06 47.50\\nDefence (Civil) 0.08 0.05 0.04 22.13\\nPolice 0.11 0.05 0.03 53.22\\nSpace 0.07 0.02 0.04 -48.74\\nHealth and Family Welfare 0.06 0.01 0.02 -16.33\\nNote: * of which ₹1.44 lakh crore is on account of Inter Account Transfer to Reserve Funds from the Capital \\nSection.

This contraction was led by a reduction of the subsidy expenditure as the economy recovered from the pandemic. The subsidy expenditure was brought down from 3.6 per cent of GDP in FY21 to 1.9 per cent of GDP in FY22 PA. It was further budgeted to reduce to 1.2 per cent of GDP in FY23. \\n3.22 Due to the sudden outbreak of geopolitical conflict resulting in higher international \\nprices for food, fertiliser and fuel, there was a higher food and fertiliser subsidy requirement \\nfor supporting the people and ensuring macroeconomic stability. Around 94.7 per cent of the budgeted expenditure on subsidies has been utilised from April to November 2022. In the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for FY23, the Union Government has sought an additional ₹80,000 crore for the expenditure towards food subsidy and additional allocation under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) and ₹1.09 lakh crore for fertiliser subsidy required during the year. As a result, the revenue expenditure from April to November 2022 has grown by over 10 per cent on a YoY basis, higher than the growth noted in the corresponding period last year (Table III.1).\\n3.23 Another major component of revenue expenditure, interest payments, had maintained a \\nstable ratio of non-debt receipts and revenue expenditure during the pre-pandemic years (Figure \\nIII.10). Higher resource requirements and lower revenue collections during the pandemic resulted in higher borrowings by the Union Government. Interest payments as a proportion of receipts went up after the pandemic outbreak. However, in the medium term, as we move along the fiscal glide path, buoyancy in revenues, aggressive asset monetisation, efficiency gains, and privatisation would help pay down the public debt, thus bringing down interest payments and releasing more monies for other priorities.53\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nFigure III.10: High-interest payments as a per cent of receipts to be brought down through \\nvaried initiatives for resource mobilisation\\n36.541.2\\n29.734.1\\n25.229.4\\n202530354045\\nFY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22\\nPAFY23\\nBEPer cent\\nInterest payment/ Revenue expenditure Interest payment/ Non Debt receipts\\nInterest payment/ Gross tax Revenue\\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA \\n3.24 It is evident from this overview of the Union Government finances that the additional \\nexpenditure needs of the Centre arising during the current year are expected to be fulfilled by \\nthe more-than-anticipated revenue collections. Thus, it is expected that reaching the budget estimate for the fiscal deficit during FY23 will not be a concern for the Union Government. With resilient economic growth, continued revenue buoyancy, and careful expenditure management over the medium run, the Union Government will be on track with the fiscal path outlined by the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement. Moreover, the budgetary reforms introduced by the Union Government in the last few years will support attaining the fiscal policy targets  \\n(Box III.2).\\nBox III.2: Major reforms in the Union budget over the last few years\\nA transparent, comprehensive and realistic budgetary process enables better fiscal management.4 \\nThis section discusses some of the major governance reforms introduced in the Union Budget over \\nthe last few years that have resulted in greater efficiency in public spending.\\n1. Improved fiscal transparency and realistic revenue assumptions in the Budget\\nThe Union Government has accorded the highest priority to improving transparency in its financial \\nstatements and accounts by bringing below-the-line expenditures above the line. The Extra-Budgetary \\nborrowings of the Union Government were brought down from ₹1.48 lakh crore in FY20 and ₹1.21 \\nlakh crore in FY21 to ₹750 crore in FY22 (RE). No Extra Budgetary Resources were estimated for \\nFY23 in the Budget.\\n4Section 3- Budget preparation - Guidelines for Public Expenditure Management (IMF, 1999)- https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/expend/\\nguide3.htm54\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nIn addition to cleaner fiscal accounting, Budget 2022 based its revenue projections on realistic \\nassumptions, thus providing a buffer to the government in an uncertain global environment. These \\nmeasures credibly demonstrate the government\\'s commitment to sound fiscal management and \\nprovide an adequate buffer to deal with global challenges.\\n2. Discontinuation of Plan-Non plan classification5\\nThe Budget FY18 discontinued having Plan and Non-Plan classifications of Government expenditure. \\nThe reform gave a greater emphasis to the Revenue and Capital classification of Government \\nexpenditure. Over the years, a broad understanding had been that Plan expenditures were good and \\nNon-Plan expenditures were bad, resulting in skewed allocations in the Budget. The reform enabled effective planning and allocation of resources in the Budget.\\n3. Merger of railway Budget with the Main Budget\\n6\\nThe railway budget was merged with the Union Budget from FY18. The reform gave a holistic \\npicture of the government\\'s financial position. The initiative envisaged facilitating multimodal \\ntransport planning between highways, railways and inland waterways, which has been strengthened \\nin the subsequent years through Gatishakti. \\nThe reform has helped to enhance the efficiency of resources for both Railways and the Union \\nGovernment. While the merger has exempted Railways from paying dividends to the Government Revenues, it allows the Ministry of Finance to have a greater elbow room at the mid-year review \\nfor better allocation of resources. It has also enabled the Ministry of Finance to ensure a coherent \\nemphasis on capital expenditure across sectors in recent years.\\n4. Shifting the date of the Budget to 1 FebruaryThe date of the Budget was advanced to 1 February from the Budget FY18. The advancement of \\nBudget presentation by a month has paved the way for early completion of the Budget cycle. It has \\nalso enabled the Ministries to ensure better planning and execution of schemes from the beginning \\nof the financial year.\\nOverview of State Government Finances\\nperformance of state finances \\n3.25 State Governments improved their finances in FY22 after being adversely impacted by the \\npandemic in FY21. The combined Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD) of the States, which increased \\nto 4.1 per cent of GDP in the pandemic-affected year, was brought down to 2.8 per cent in  \\nFY22 PA. Given the geopolitical uncertainties, the consolidated GFD-GDP ratio for States has been budgeted 3.4 per cent in FY23 (Figure III.11). However, the States\\' monthly fiscal Accounts data released by O/o CAG shows that from April- November 2022, the combined borrowings of the 27 major states have just reached 33.5 per cent of their total budgeted borrowings for the year.

This growth is a continuation of the buoyancy momentum observed in the FY22 RE. On the expenditure side, revenue and capital expenditures in FY22 BE were envisaged to grow at 10.4 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively, over FY22 RE. The RBI Study on State Finances highlights that the Capital outlay, a part of the capital expenditure, has recorded a higher growth in Provisional Actuals than that estimated in the Revised estimates. The capital outlay of States grew by 31.7 per cent in FY22 PA. This increase is attributable to strong revenue buoyancy and the support provided by the Centre in terms of advance releases of payments to the states, GST compensation payments, and interest-free loans. The Centre\\'s initiatives to support State finances are discussed in the forthcoming sections.\\nCooperative fiscal federalism drives a well-targeted fiscal policy\\nTransfer from Centre to States\\n3.28 Transfer of funds to the States comprises the share of States in Union taxes devolved to the \\nStates, Finance Commission Grants, Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), and other transfers. \\nTotal transfers to States have risen between FY19 and FY23 BE (refer to Table III.6).56\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nTable III.6: Details of transfers from Centre to States (other than devolution to States)\\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 RE FY23 BE\\n(in ₹ lakh crore)\\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes 3.0 3.1 3.8 4.2 4.4\\nFinance Commission Grants 0.9 1.2 1.8 2.1 1.9\\nOther Grants/Loans/Transfers 0.9 2.0 1.9 2.3 3.0\\nSource: Union budget documents\\n3.29 The Finance Commission had recommended allocation of an amounting to ₹1.92 lakh \\ncrore for FY23 in respect of post-devolution revenue deficit grants, grants to local bodies, health \\nsector grants, and disaster management grants under Article 275 of the Constitution.

To meet the shortfall in GST compensation for States, the Government, in addition to the release of regular GST compensation from the Fund, borrowed ₹ 2.69 lakh crore during FY21 and FY22 and passed it on to States on a back-to-back basis. Moreover, the cess payments and tax devolution instalments to the States were frontloaded to give them early access to funds. During FY23, the Government of India released ₹1.16 lakh crore towards the total GST compensation payable to States up to 30 June 2022 (as of 25 November 2022). Even though the total Cess collection until November 2022 was insufficient to make this entire payment to the States, the Centre released the balance from its resources. Box III.3 discusses the impact of GST on the flow of resources to the states.\\nBox III.3: GST and the flow of resources to states\\nThe last five years of experience with GST have seen several rounds of policy debates around rate \\nrationalisation, simplification of return filing, compensation cess levies on products, compensation \\npayments to states etc. One pertinent question that has not been carefully studied is the impact of GST \\non the flow of resources to the states. While comparing the total fiscal resources accruing to States57\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nin the pre and post-GST regimes, it is essential to measure the relative performance of taxes vis-à-vis \\nthe performance of the economy. In the pre-GST regime, when the economy grew at 11.5 per cent \\nnominally, the total fiscal resources accruing to States from the Central and state taxes subsumed in \\nGST (including devolution) grew at 11.1 per cent. It implied a buoyancy of 0.97 (See table 3A).\\nTable 3A- Pre-GST period - Total fiscal resources to States from taxes subsumed in GST  \\n(including devolution)\\nFY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17CAGR (FY17 \\nover FY13)\\n₹ lakh crore\\nState taxes subsumed in GST\\nStates taxes subsumed in GST 3.22 3.48 3.73 4.41 4.41\\nCentral taxes subsumed in GST 1.66 1.90 2.02 2.48 3.14\\nDevolution factor 0.32 0.32 0.32 0.42 0.42\\nTotal fiscal resources to States \\nfrom taxes subsumed in GST3.75 4.08 4.38 5.46 5.73 11.1%\\nNominal GDP 99.44 112.34 124.68 137.72 153.92 11.5%\\nPre-GST buoyancy of revenue from taxes subsumed in GST accruing to states0.97\\nIn the post-GST period, total fiscal resources accruing to the states from the GST (including \\ndevolution from the Centre\\'s GST) exhibited a buoyancy greater than that in the pre-GST period (Table 3B). This performance is especially noteworthy, considering the reduction of the effective weighted average GST rate from 14.4 per cent at the time of inception to 11.6 per cent in 2019 (RBI).\\nTable 3B- Post-GST period - Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system (including \\ndevolution)\\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*CAGR (FY23 \\nover FY19)\\n₹ lakh crore\\nCGST collections 2.02 2.27 2.10 2.69 3.14\\nSGST collections 2.79 3.09 2.73 3.44 3.98\\nIGST collections 5.99 5.87 5.66 7.62 9.40\\nGST compensation paid for the \\nyear0.85 1.66 1.68 0.69 0.35\\nBack-to-back loans   1.10 1.59  58\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*CAGR (FY23 \\nover FY19)\\nTotal fiscal resources to states from the GST system* \\n(1) SGST + IGST for states + \\nDevolution from Centre’s GST7.89 8.21 7.61 9.96 11.95 10.9%\\n(2) SGST + IGST for states + Devolution from Centre’s GST + Compensation8.74 9.87 9.29 10.65 12.30 8.9%\\n(3) SGST + IGST for states + Devolution from Centre’s GST + Compensation + loans8.74 9.87 10.39 12.24 12.30 8.9%\\nIndia Nominal GDP 189.00 200.75 198.01 236.65 273.09 9.6%\\nPost-GST buoyancy of GST revenues accruing to states (excluding compensation/loans)1.13\\nNote: (a) The devolution factor is taken as 0.32 from FY13 to FY15; 0.42 from FY16 to FY20; and 0.41 from FY21 \\nonwards, as per the recommendation of the respective Finance Commission.\\n(b) IGST for States is taken as 50% of total IGST collection.

However, with only the \\nGST collections through domestic supplies, the post GST buoyancy is still greater than 1 (=1.05).\\nIn addition to the regular stream of revenues from GST, a compensation was also provided to the \\nstates in the post-GST period. Since GST was a new tax regime, the compensation scheme was \\ndesigned to safeguard the states for any difference in the new versus the old tax regime by ensuring \\nsteady revenue growth of 14 per cent per annum for five years. The compensation arrangement was also meant to help states ride out the differences in the inter-state distribution of GST. It is pertinent \\nto note here that the compensation system was not envisaged as a buffer to the state\\'s revenues in the \\neventuality of a fall in tax revenues resulting from a collapse in economic growth. \\nNevertheless, the incidence of the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of GST Compensation as \\na buffer to the States\\' revenues. During FY21, revenues for Centre and states were adversely affected \\ndue to the economic contraction. The compensation requirement by the states increased substantially \\namidst a decline in the CGST and the compensation cess collections. Despite having limited fiscal \\nresources in the middle of a crisis, the Centre borrowed funds and passed them on to States on a back-to-back loan basis, in addition to the release of regular GST compensation. These loans will be repaid \\nfrom future inflows into the GST Compensation Cess Fund and hence are not a burden on the states. 59\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nTable 3C: Compensation scheme supported the SGST revenues from FY19 to FY23\\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*\\n₹ lakh crore, unless specified\\n(1) SGST+ States\\' share in IGST 5.78 6.03 5.56 7.25 8.69\\nYoY growth 4.2% -7.8% 30.5% 19.8%\\n(2) SGST + States’ share in IGST + \\nCompensation6.63 7.68 7.24 7.94 9.04\\nYoY growth 15.9% -5.7% 9.7% 13.5%\\n(3) SGST + States’ share in IGST + Compensation + Loans6.63 7.68 8.34 9.53 9.04\\nYoY growth 15.9% 8.6% 14.3% -5.2%\\nNote: (a) * The collection for FY23 have been extrapolated based on the average collections from May to Dec 2022; \\n(b) The YoY growth in all-inclusive SGST, compensation, and loans (Item 3 in Table above) is negative for FY23 since \\nthe compensation payments were applicable only till June 2022.

It was fixed at 5 per \\ncent of GSDP in FY21, 4 per cent of GSDP in FY22 and 3.5 per cent of GSDP in FY23. A part of this additional borrowing was linked to reforms encouraging the States to undertake them. For instance, in FY21, a part of the additional borrowing ceiling was conditional on implementing the \\'One Nation One Ration Card\\' System, ease of doing business reform, urban Local body/ utility reforms, and power sector reforms. As a result, 17 States implemented the One Nation One Ration Card System, 20 States completed the stipulated reforms in the Ease of Doing Business, 11 States had done local body reforms and 17 States carried out fully/partly Power Sector Reforms. Similarly, a part of the additional borrowing was earmarked for incremental capital expenditure to be incurred by States during FY22. Sixteen states accessed the additional borrowings upon meeting the Capex target. 60\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n3.32 In addition to the net borrowing ceilings fixed for the States, Fifteenth Finance Commission \\nhad recommended performance-based additional borrowing space of 0.50 per cent of Gross \\nState Domestic Product (GSDP) to the States in the power sector. This special dispensation has been recommended for each year for four years, from FY22 to 2024-25. For the financial year FY22, additional borrowing permission of ₹39,175 crore was allowed to 12 States for meeting the stipulated reform criteria.          \\nCentre\\'s support towards States\\' capital expenditure\\n3.33 The Union government has provided 50-year interest-free loans to state governments \\nunder the \\'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment\\' for the last three years. Amounts of ₹11,830 crore and ₹14,186 crore were provided to states in FY21 and FY22. A part of the allocation for FY22 was earmarked for providing incentives to the States for privatisation/disinvestment of the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and monetisation/recycling of assets. During the year FY23, the allocation under the Scheme has been raised to ₹1.05 lakh crore to give further impetus to State Capex plans. This amount includes an unconditional component and smaller components linked to specific reforms/initiatives (Table III.8). Notably, if state governments were allowed this ₹1 lakh crore as an additional borrowing limit, they would bear an interest rate higher than the rate at which the Union government borrows. Further, they may use it for revenue expenditure. This interest-free loan in the present arrangement is dedicated only to capital expenditure.\\nTable III.8: Details of Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital  \\nInvestment\\' for FY23\\ncomponent Basis allocated approved Released\\n(₹ crore)\\n1Allocation proportional to the share of tax \\ndevolution for FY2380000 68,592 31,571\\nII PM Gati Shakti-related expenditure 5,000 1,458 1,458\\nIII PMGSY 4,000 1,616 1,616\\nIV Incentive for digitisation 2,000\\nV Optical fiber cable 2,215 2,011\\nVI Urban reforms 6,000\\nVII Disinvestment and monetisation 5,000\\nSource: Department of Expenditure\\nBox III.4: Initiatives by the State Governments to improve their own resources\\nThe pandemic has stretched state finances by expanding the expenditure needs and adversely hitting \\nthe revenues.

For \\nIndia, the total liabilities of the Union Government, which were relatively stable as a percentage \\nof GDP over the past decade, witnessed a sharp spike in the pandemic year FY21. This spike in debt resulted from the pandemic-induced higher Government borrowings to finance the additional expenditure needs, given the strained revenues and sharp contraction in the GDP.

However, the ratio has come off its peak in FY22 (RE). The General Government deficits as a per cent of GDP have also consolidated after their peak in F21. The General Government is expected to follow the path of fiscal consolidation in the medium term.\\nFigure III.17: General Government liabilities to GDP ratio come off their peak attained in FY21\\n 66.668.5 68.8 69.8 70.875.789.6\\n84.586.5\\n7.213.1\\n10.3\\n9.4\\n3.99.2\\n5.5\\n4.2\\n30405060708090100\\n024681012141618\\nFY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 RE FY23 BE\\nPer cent of GDPPer cent of GDP\\nOutstanding liabilities of General Government (RHS)\\nGross Fiscal Deficit\\nGross Revenue Deficit\\nSource: RBI\\nA positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the Government Debt sustainable\\n3.39. The emphasis on capex in recent years is expected to boost GDP growth directly, and \\nindirectly through multiplier effects on private consumption expenditure and private investment. \\nHigher GDP growth would thereby facilitate buoyant revenue collection in the medium term, and thereby enable a sustainable fiscal path. The General Government Debt to GDP ratio increased from 75.7 per cent of end-March 2020 to 89.6 per cent at the end of the pandemic year FY21. It is estimated to decline to 84.5 per cent of GDP by end-March 2022. The emphasis on capex-led growth will enable India to keep the growth-interest rate differential positive. As shown in Figure III.18 below, this differential has historically been positive for India. A positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the debt levels sustainable. Box III.5 shows that steady economic growth will accelerate fiscal consolidation in the economy.65\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nFigure III.18: Growth-interest rate differential for India\\nSource: RBI, IMF\\n3.40. A comparison of the change in General Government debt to GDP ratio from 2005 to 2021 \\nacross the countries highlights a substantial increase for most countries. For India, this increase \\nis modest, from 81 per cent of GDP in 2005 to around 84 per cent of GDP in 2021 (Figure III.19). It has been possible on the back of resilient economic growth during the last 15 years leading to a positive growth-interest rate differential, which, in turn, has resulted in sustainable Government debt to GDP levels.\\nFigure III.19: Comparing General Government debt to GDP ratio in 2005 with 2021  \\nacross the countries\\nSource: World Economic Outlook, October 2022.\\n174% 66% 128%\\n39% 95%\\n67% 113%\\n26% 72%\\n30% 69%\\n69% 93%\\n81% 84%\\n68% 70%\\n41% 43%263%\\n2005\\n202166\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nBox III.5: Sustained growth as the path to fiscal consolidation\\nThe high fiscal deficit to GDP ratio witnessed in the aftermath of the pandemic is a concern for countries \\nworldwide. A solution to the increased fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios lies in persistently high \\ngrowth for a few years. A simple counterfactual experiment shows that sustained growth of 10 per \\ncent per annum would have resulted in much lower Union Government deficit and debt ratios for India in the post-pandemic years, despite keeping the expenditure levels the same. \\nUnder Scenario 1, the impact of a higher nominal GDP growth is evaluated on fiscal deficit and debt \\nratios, keeping the revenues and expenditures the same as actual. A counterfactual nominal GDP is \\nestimated, assuming a growth rate of 10 per cent each year from FY20 to FY22. The actual Central Government fiscal deficit as a per cent of the counterfactual GDP is estimated as 4.5 per cent in \\nFY20, 8 per cent in FY21, and 6.3 per cent in FY22, lower than the actual ratios observed (see rows (A) and (E) of Table 5A). Similarly, the ratio of Central Government debt to the estimated GDP is \\nalso lower than the actual debt-GDP ratio (see rows (B) and (F) of Table 5A).\\nTable 5A: Counterfactual Experiment to show sustained growth results in  \\nlower deficit and debt ratios\\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 Row\\nActual GDP (₹ lakh crore) 189.0 200.7 198.0 236.6\\nGrowth in actual GDP (%) 6.2 -1.4 19.5\\nAssumed growth in GDP (%) 10.0 10.0 10.0\\nEstimated GDP (₹ lakh crore) 207.9 228.7 251.6\\nscenario 1\\nActual Fiscal Deficit/Estimated GDP (%) 4.5 8.0 6.3 (A)\\nActual Central Govt Debt/Estimated GDP (%) 50.9 54.8 55.5 (B)\\nscenario 2Assumed revenue buoyancy\\n0.8 1.6 1.6\\nEstimated revenue collection (₹ lakh crore) 18.1 21.0 24.3\\nEstimated fiscal deficit (₹ lakh crore) 8.8 14.1 13.7\\nEstimated fiscal deficit/ Estimated GDP 4.2 6.2 5.4 (C)\\nscenario 3Assumed revenue buoyancy\\n0.8 0.9 1.6\\nEstimated revenue collection (₹ lakh crore) 18.1 19.6 22.7\\nEstimated fiscal deficit (₹ lakh crore) 8.8 15.5 15.2\\nEstimated fiscal deficit/ Estimated GDP 4.2 6.8 6.1 (D)67\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nmemo items\\nActual Expenditure  (₹ lakh crore) 23.2 26.9 35.1 37.9\\nActual Revenues  (₹ lakh crore) 16.7 17.5 16.9 22.1\\nActual Fiscal deficit (₹ lakh crore) 6.5 9.3 18.2 15.9\\nActual Fiscal Deficit/Actual GDP (%) 4.7 9.2 6.7 (E)\\nActual Central Govt Debt/Actual GDP (%)  52.7 63.3 59.0 (F)\\nSources: Newspaper reports, RBI\\nHowever, higher GDP growth rate also impacts the fiscal deficit through higher revenues. Scenario \\n2 of the analysis incorporates the impact of higher GDP growth on the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio \\nthrough the revenue channel. The expenditure levels were retained as actuals in the analysis. The \\nactual revenue buoyancies for FY20 and FY22 and the budgeted revenue buoyancy for FY21 were considered to quantify the impact of higher GDP growth on revenues. The budgeted revenue \\nbuoyancy was taken for FY21 because the actual buoyancy ratio could not be interpreted in the year \\nof nominal GDP contraction. The fiscal deficit was calculated using the estimated revenues and \\nactual expenditures for respective years. The estimated fiscal deficit as a proportion of GDP came out \\nto be 4.2 for FY20, 6.2 for FY21, and 5.4 for FY22, much lower than the actual observed (see rows (C) and (E) of Table 5A).  \\nFurther, we see in scenario 3 that by taking the previous 5-year average revenue buoyancy for FY21 \\ninstead of the budgeted buoyancy and retaining actual revenue buoyancies for FY20 and FY22, the \\nfiscal deficit to GDP ratio is still lower than the actual observed (see rows (D) and (E) of Table 5A). \\nThe messages from this counterfactual exercise are simple: even moderate growth, if sustained, \\nwill support fiscal consolidation in the medium run and result in sustainable public finances. Two, India\\'s public debt and deficit ratios went up sharply in recent years, not just on account of higher \\nspending and lower tax revenues due to the pandemic but also due to the denominator undershooting \\ntrends resulting from financial system stress, followed by the pandemic. With both out of the way, nominal growth should return to its trend path, and hence, fiscal parameters would begin to show \\nimprovement. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence, \\nbut an undue alarm is unwarranted.\\nconclusion\\n3.41. The Government of India has adopted a holistic policy towards fiscal stability in the last \\nfew years. Using the crisis as an opportunity to bring about reforms, the government undertook \\na series of policy measures in the previous few years. These policies range from bringing in budget transparency and using prudent assumptions in the Budget to transforming the tax ecosystem by implementing technology, rationalising GST, reducing tax rates, simplifying tax compliances, and ending the uncertainty around retrospective taxation. All these measures have led to a greater formalisation of the economy, enhanced compliances and better reporting of the income by the public and imparted credibility to the government\\'s commitment to fiscal management.68\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n3.42. The spike in India\\'s debt and deficit ratios has not only been due to higher spending \\nnecessitated by the pandemic-induced cessation of economic activity but also due to the \\ncontraction or slower growth in the denominator (nominal GDP). In FY20, India\\'s GDP growth slowed down due to the ongoing stress in the financial system. While the banking sector was undergoing repair and was recapitalising, the non-banking financial sector crisis renewed the uncertainties for the banking system. This kept credit growth muted, leading to slower GDP growth.\\n11 The pandemic aggravated the situation in FY21, which caused the nominal GDP to \\ncontract, a rare occurrence in India. A detailed discussion may be seen in Chapter 2.\\n3.43. As India\\'s economic recovery advances, amidst the continuing global uncertainties and \\nrisks, the fiscal glide path illuminates the path for fiscal policy. That will ensure more significant fiscal space for policy action in uncertain times. Further, in reality, fiscal discipline translates into a fiscal stimulus for all sections of the economy through lower interest rates. As governments make their fiscal situations sustainable and stick to that path, the risk premium embedded in their interest rates comes down, thus lowering the cost of capital for all sections of society - on their educational loans, housing loans, car loans and business loans – and putting more money in their hands. For EMDE, the stimulus effect of fiscal deficit, via diminishing risk-premium, is likely greater than it is for advanced economies. That is the reality, as financial markets do not treat advanced and emerging economies similarly on fiscal deficits. Therefore, it stands to reason that they reap greater rewards for fiscal prudence. As stated earlier, this is particularly relevant in an era of rising interest rates.\\n3.44. The Centre should continue incentivising the States for reforms and higher capital spending \\nto ensure a stronger General government. The capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium term.\\n11IMF Working paper (WP/22/137)- Financial Sector and Economic Growth in India by Margaux MacDonald ; TengTeng Xu (July 2022) – \\n(https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Financial-Sector-and-Economic-Growth-in-India-520580 )69\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nannexe\\nAnnexe 1:  Data on longer-term trends in Union government finances\\nTable 1: Union Government\\'s Fiscal Parameters\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE\\nIn ₹ lakh crore\\nRevenue Receipts 14.35 15.53 16.84 16.34 21.68 22.04\\nGross Tax Revenue 19.19 20.80 20.10 20.27 27.08 27.58\\nNet tax revenue 12.42 13.17 13.57 14.26 18.20 19.35\\nNon-tax revenue 1.93 2.36 3.27 2.08 3.48 2.70\\nNon-debt capital receipts 1.16 1.13 0.69 0.58 0.39 0.79\\nNon-debt receipts 15.51 16.66 17.53 16.92 22.08 22.84\\nTotal Expenditure 21.42 23.15 26.86 35.10 37.94 39.45\\nRevenue Expenditure 18.79 20.07 23.51 30.84 32.01 31.95\\nCapital Expenditure 2.63 3.08 3.36 4.26 5.93 7.50\\nFiscal Deficit 5.91 6.49 9.34 18.18 15.87 16.61\\nRevenue Deficit 4.44 4.54 6.67 14.50 10.33 9.90\\nPrimary Deficit 0.62 0.67 3.22 11.38 7.81 7.21\\nMemo Item       \\nGDP at Market Price 170.90 188.87 200.75 198.01 236.65 258.00\\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA\\nTable2: Union Government\\'s Fiscal Parameters (Per cent of GDP)\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE\\nRevenue Receipts 8.4 8.2 8.4 8.3 9.2 8.5\\nGross Tax Revenue 11.2 11.0 10.0 10.2 11.4 10.7\\nNet tax revenue 7.3 7.0 6.8 7.2 7.7 7.5\\nNon-tax revenue 1.1 1.2 1.6 1.0 1.5 1.0\\nNon-debt capital receipts 0.7 0.6 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.3\\nNon-debt receipts 9.1 8.8 8.7 8.5 9.3 8.9\\nTotal Expenditure 12.5 12.3 13.4 17.7 16.0 15.3\\nRevenue Expenditure 11.0 10.6 11.7 15.6 13.5 12.4\\nCapital Expenditure 1.5 1.6 1.7 2.2 2.5 2.9\\nFiscal Deficit 3.5 3.4 4.7 9.2 6.7 6.4\\nRevenue Deficit 2.6 2.4 3.3 7.3 4.4 3.8\\nPrimary Deficit 0.4 0.4 1.6 5.7 3.3 2.8\\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA70\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nTable 3: Growth rate of Union Government\\'s Fiscal Indicators ( in per cent)\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE(1)FY23 BE(2)\\nRevenue Receipts 4.4 8.2 8.4 -3.0 32.7 6.0 1.7\\nGross Tax Revenue 11.8 8.4 -3.4 0.8 33.6 9.6 1.8\\nNet tax revenue 12.8 6.0 3.0 5.1 27.6 9.6 6.3\\nNon-tax revenue -29.4 22.3 38.8 -36.5 67.6 -14.1 -22.5\\nNon-debt capital receipts 77.0 -2.5 -39.2 -16.0 -32.0 -20.7 102.2\\nNon-debt receipts 7.7 7.4 5.2 -3.5 30.5 4.8 3.4\\nTotal Expenditure 8.4 8.1 16.0 30.7 8.1 4.6 4.0\\nRevenue Expenditure 11.1 6.8 17.1 31.2 3.8 0.9 -0.2\\nCapital Expenditure -7.5 16.9 9.1 27.0 39.1 24.5 26.6\\nFiscal Deficit 10.4 9.9 43.8 94.8 -12.7 4.4 4.7\\nRevenue Deficit 40.2 2.5 46.7 117.5 -28.7 -9.0 -4.1\\nPrimary Deficit 13.1 7.5 381.6 254.0 -31.4 -7.3 -7.8\\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA\\nNote: (1) Growth in FY23 BE over FY22 RE  (2) Growth in FY23 BE over FY22 PA\\nAnnexe 2:  Indirect tax measures by CBIC during 2021-22\\nThe reforms initiated by the government in recent years have ensured the development of \\na trust-based tax system. Progress has been made to move to an efficient and effective tax administration, which honours honest taxpayers and provides better taxpayer facilitation while advancing the government\\'s policy of facilitating Ease of Doing Business.\\nEase of Compliance for Taxpayers\\n● A new scheme of updated return has been introduced in the Income-tax Act of 1961, which facilitates the taxpayer to voluntarily update his return anytime within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year by paying an additional tax. This scheme encourages voluntary compliance and reduces litigation.\\n● The scope of information in the pre-filled Income tax Returns (ITR) has been further expanded by including information such as house property income, capital gains from securities, bank interest, and dividends to make tax compliance more convenient.\\n● A new provision to effect business reorganisation has been made under the Income-tax Act, 1961, requiring the successor entity to file a modified return within six months of the order of the reorganisation being passed by the Competent Authority. \\n● The procedures for assessment, appeal and levy of penalty under the Income-tax Act have been made faceless by eliminating the human interface between the Assessing Officer and the assessee, optimising the use of resources through functional specialisation and streamlining the procedures to enable efficient implementation.71\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nReduction in litigation\\n● A Dispute Resolution Committee is constituted to reduce litigation and give an impetus to \\ndispute resolution for small taxpayers. A taxpayer having taxable income up to ₹50 lakh and disputed income up to ₹10 lakh shall be eligible to approach the Committee. The procedure of the Committee will be conducted electronically to ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability.\\n● Taking forward the policy of litigation management and to avoid repetitive appeals, a new provision has been made under the Income-tax Act, 1961, wherein if a question of law in the case of an assessee is identical to a question of law pending in appeal before the jurisdictional High Court or the Supreme Court in his case or any other case, the filing of further appeal to the Appellate Tribunal or the jurisdictional High Court in the case of the assessee shall be deferred till such question of law is decided by the relevant Court subject to certain conditions.\\nMeasures undertaken to curb tax evasion & facilitate the widening of the tax base\\n● A formal mechanism of sharing information through the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and e-Verification scheme has recently been enabled. These measures further the aim of widening and deepening the tax base by ensuring authorities possess all relevant financial information of an assessee, thus allowing access to such information to a taxpayer for accurate filing of his return of income. \\n● The Finance Act 2022 has also introduced specific provisions for the taxation of virtual digital assets (VDA), where the transfer of VDA is to be taxed at the rate of 30% with no deduction in respect of expenditure (other than the cost of acquisition) to be allowed. Moreover, loss from the transfer of virtual digital assets cannot be set off from any other income and cannot be carried forward to subsequent years. Further, the transfer of VDA is subject to TDS of 1% of the transaction value (whether in cash/ kind/ both). The gift of VDA would also be taxed in the hands of the recipient. \\n● Deduction of tax at source on benefit or perquisite in respect of business or profession has also been introduced in Finance Act 2022 to widen and deepen the tax base. A person providing any benefit or perquisite to a resident would deduct TDS of 10% of the value or aggregate of the value of such benefit or perquisite (whether in cash/kind/ both). \\n● Finance Act 2022 has provided that no set off of any loss shall be allowed against undisclosed income detected during search and survey operations to bring certainty and increase deterrence among tax evaders.\\n● Vide Finance Act 2022, provisions applicable to bonus stripping have also been made applicable to securities. It has also been provided that the provisions on bonus stripping and dividend stripping shall also apply to units of an Infrastructure Investment Trust or a Real Estate Investment Trust, or units of Alternative Investment Funds.\\nTax incentives\\n● Finance Act 2022 has provided income tax relief to the amount received by a taxpayer for medical treatment from an employer or from any person for treatment of Covid-19 during FY 2019-2020 and subsequent years. Income-tax relief has also been provided to ex-gratia 72\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\npayment received from the employer/ other person by family members of a person who has \\ndied on account of Covid-19 during FY 2019-2020 and subsequent years. \\n● Tax relief has also been widened to the persons with disability. The payment of annuity and lump sum amount from insurance scheme is to be allowed to differently abled dependent during the lifetime of parents/guardians, i.e., on parents/ guardian attaining the age of 60 years or more and where such contribution to the scheme has been discontinued. \\n● To bring parity between employees of State and Central government, the tax deduction limit on employer contribution has been increased from existing 10% to 14% of salary in NPS Tier-I Account for State Government employees as well. This would also help in enhancing social security benefits. \\n● To promote start-ups, the Income Tax Act of 1961 allows for a deduction of 100% of the profit and gains of eligible start-ups for three consecutive years out of ten years. However, due to Covid-19, there have been delays in setting up such eligible businesses. To lend a supporting hand to these start-ups, the period of incorporation of the eligible start-up has been extended to 31.03.2023 vide Finance Act 2022.\\n● To provide a level playing field between cooperative societies and companies, the alternate minimum tax rate paid by cooperatives has been reduced from 18.5% to 15%. Further, surcharge on cooperative societies has been reduced from 12% to 7% for those having total income of more than ₹1 crore and up to ₹10 crore.\\n● For concessional tax regime to establish a globally competitive environment, the date of commencement of manufacturing or production of an article or thing for a newly established manufacturing entity for availing 15% concessional tax rate under section 115BAB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 has been extended from 31st March 2023 to 31st March 2024. \\n● Over the past few years, several tax concessions have been provided to units located in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) under the Income-tax Act, 1961, to make it a global hub of the financial services sector. To further incentivise operations from IFSC, the following have been made exempt from tax subject to specified conditions vide Finance Act, 2022:\\n i. Income of a non-resident from offshore derivative instruments\\n ii. Income from over-the-counter derivatives issued by an offshore banking unit\\n iii. Income from royalty and interest on account of the lease of a ship\\n iv. Income received from portfolio management services in IFSC\\nAnnexe 3: Measures by CBIC undertaken during FY23\\nReform measures as regards customs:\\n● The Customs duty rate structure has been guided by a conscious policy of the government to \\nincentivise domestic value addition under Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, which inter alia envisages imposition of lower duty on raw materials and providing reasonable tariff support to goods being manufactured in India. The customs duty structure has been calibrated to incentivise investment in key areas like petroleum exploration, 73\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\nelectronic manufacturing, etc. In accordance with this policy, the MFN rates of BCD have \\nbeen increased in recent years on such items which are being manufactured in India or which domestic industry aspires to manufacture. Accordingly, during the last 6 years, about 4000 tariff lines (approximately 1/3rd of total tariff lines) have seen upward calibration of BCD. Such items include, metals, metal products, auto parts, footwear, fabrics, garments, specified chemicals, toys, certain machinery, medical equipment, a number of MSME items like bells, gongs, ceramic wares, table ware, utensils, hardware etc, consumer electronics and home appliances including mobile, TV , refrigerators, washing machine, AC, fans, heaters, hair dryers, shavers, toasters, ovens etc. At the same time, duties of inputs and raw materials have been rationalised. \\n● Phased Manufacturing Plan (PMP) in respect of significant products like mobile phones, other electronic goods like TVs, electric vehicles, batteries, solar panel etc- The BCD rates in respect of different stages of the value chain of these products are calibrated in a manner that encourages gradual deepening of domestic value addition. For example, in respect of mobile phones, initially the parts were placed under nil BCD while duty was imposed on mobiles. Gradually, duty has been raised on parts in phased manner as their production began in India. \\n● India stands fully compliant with all the commitments under WTO\\'s Trade Facilitation Agreement. Compliance has been achieved well within the stipulated timeline of February 2022 and the same stands duly notified and acknowledged by the World Trade Organisation. The heartening results achieved can be evidenced from the significant improvements in the standings in the United Nation\\'s Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation, wherein, India has witnessed a sustained improvement in the Trade Facilitation score to 90.32% in 2021 from 78.49% in 2019. India is the best performing country when compared with South and South West Asia (63.12%) region. \\n● With the objective to enhance the uniformity in the physical examination process of EXIM cargo and reduce the time and cost involved in the process, CBIC has introduced Risk Management based uniform cargo examination orders at all Customs locations across the country, vide Circular No. 16/2022-Customs dated 29th of August, 2022.\\n● Continuing with the trend to implement measures to facilitate taxpayers, CBIC has notified the Customs (Electronic Cash Ledger), Regulations, 2022 dated 30.03.2022 to enable the importer, exporter or any person liable to pay Customs duty, fees etc., to deposit an advance with the government instead of making transaction wise payment as was being done earlier. Such deposit can be utilised for payment of duties and other sums relating to Customs by seamlessly debiting the requisite amount from the ECL. Additionally, CBIC has launched an Anonymised Escalation Mechanism for handling the grievances related to delay in clearances. In the above mechanism, CBIC\\'s ICEGATE registered users can submit their grievance for delayed clearances under faceless assessment and escalate it anonymously to the concerned assessing as well as the higher officers at relevant FAG Port (Faceless Assessment Group). The Anonymized Escalation facility also enables users to track the status of the grievances submitted by them till the final resolution. 74\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n● With an objective to utilise technology to optimise internal processes, CBIC has launched \\na pilot project for implementation of Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS) on 14.10.2021, based on blockchain technology for tracking movement of goods from the port to a warehouse at ICD Tughlakabad ensuring secured documentation & GPS based tracking of containers.\\n● Indian Customs has notified IGCRS Rules, 2022 vide Notification 74/2022 dated 9th September, 2022 superseding the existing Customs (Import of Goods at Concessional Rate of Duty) Rules, 2017. These rules have come into effect from 10th September 2022. These rules have introduced significant changes for simplifying and automating the procedures for import of goods at concessional Rate of Duty in accordance with the larger goals of \"Ease of doing business\" by accommodating long standing demands from the trade such as inclusion of job work, clearance of capital goods at depreciated value, making the entire process simple and online and doing away with any need for physical interface with officers.\\nChanges in Customs Law and Procedure:\\n● As a trade facilitation measure, the validity of e-scrips issued under the Electronic Duty Credit Ledger Regulations, 2021, has been increased from one year to two years from the date of their generation. Further, the recovery provisions from the transferee holder of the e-scrips (issued under RoDTEP and RoSCTL schemes) and suspension of its credit account have also been omitted.\\n● In order to leverage the vast network of post offices across the country and enable MSME\\'s (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) to export to global markets using e-commerce or other regular channels, the CBIC in collaboration with the Department of Posts (Dop) has notified the Postal Exports (Electronic Declaration and processing) Regulations, 2022. Under the new system, an exporter need not visit a Foreign post Office (FPO) to file the Postal Bill of Export (PBE) and present export parcel. Rather, he is enabled to file the PBE online from his home/office and handover the export parcel to postal authorities at a nearby booking post office. Postal authorities shall arrange secure transport of export parcel from booking post office to an FPO, where customs clearance shall take place.\\n● Circular No.8/2022-Customs dated 17.5.2022 has been issued to enable exports from Bangladesh to India by rail in closed containers, with clearance at hinterland ICDs. A transshipment module has also been developed in the Indian Customs EDI system to digitise the procedure. This would decongest the border trade points and facilitate Bangladesh\\'s exports.\\n● Vide Circular No. 17/2022-Customs dated 9.9.2022, CBIC has enabled export of containerised cargo from any inland Container Depot (ICD) to Bangladesh using a combination of rail/road route and riverine route. For instance, the containerised cargo after customs clearance at an ICD shall be transported to Kolkata/Haldia port by rail or road, from where it shall be loaded on a barge for export to Bangladesh using riverine route. Customs clearance shall take place at the ICD and only preventive checks are conducted at Kolkata/Haldia. This facility is expected to help reduce congestion of export cargo at land Customs Stations.75\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\n● With a view to leveraging the potential of inland Waterways for enhancing trade and transit, \\nCBIC has allowed movement of containerised export goods of Bangladesh through India using a combination of riverine and rail routes. This facility, allowed Vide Circular No. 19/2022-Customs dated 14.9.2022, involves entry of containerised cargo on a barge/vessel from Bangladesh into India up to the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia using the riverine route. From the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia, the goods will travel by rail to the sea port of Nhava Sheva or Mundra for final export to third countries by sea route. The Circular lays down detailed procedure and documentation and provides for track and trace facility using ECTS (Electronics Cargo Tracking System). This arrangement is expected to save time and cost for the traders by providing an alternate and more efficient trade route.\\n● Vide Circular No. 09/2022-Customs dated 30.6.2022, CBIC has put in place a simplified regulatory framework for e-commerce exports of jewellery via international Courier Terminals (ICTs). To accommodate the e-commerce business need, it incorporates a re-import process for return of jewellery. For this purpose, the Courier import and export (Electronic Declaration and Processing) Regulations, 2010 have been amended vide Notification No. 57/2022-Customs (N.T) dated 30.6.2022. The simplified framework is applicable on e-commerce export of jewellery made of precious metals (whether or not studded or set with precious or semi-precious stones). This reform is aimed at supporting the Make-in-India brand in the international markets and enhancing the competitiveness of Indian jewellery exports leveraging the rapidly evolving global e-Market space.\\nChanges in Excise Duty:\\n● Retail selling prices of petrol and diesel in the country are linked to crude prices. The crude prices have been varying for the past few months. Indian basket is moving upwards and reached beyond $110 per barrel in May, 2022. The Dollar exchange rate was also on the upward trend and is hovering around ₹77 per USD, impacting the prices of Petrol and Diesel. The Retail selling price of petrol and diesel have risen from ₹95.41 per litre and ₹86.67 per litre respectively in March 2022 to ₹105.41 per litre and ₹96.67 per litre respectively on 21 May, 2022. This has necessitated a reduction in Excise Duty on petrol and diesel. Extensive deliberations were held at various stakeholders including Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and it was decided to rationalise Central Excise duty rates on Petrol and Diesel by ₹8 per litre on Petrol and ₹6 per litre on Diesel. The proposed reductions has been given effect to by reducing the Road and Infrastructure Cess (RIC).  \\nChanges in GST (Rates):\\n● In 2022, the following changes were made to GST rates on goods and services:\\n● In the 47th GST Council meeting, it was decided to increase the GST rates on items such as Printing, writing or drawing ink, Power driven pumps primarily designed for handling water such as centrifugal pumps, Pawan Chakki, Drawing and marking out instruments, Solar Water Heater and system etc to correct inverted duty structure in these items. Similarly, GST rates on certain services such as Services supplied by foreman to chit fund, Job work in relation to processing of hides, skins and leather, Job work in relation to manufacture of leather goods and footwear etc were also calibrated to correct inverted duty structure. 76\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n● Hitherto, GST was exempted on specified food items, grains etc when not branded, or right \\non the brand has been foregone. In the 47th GST Council Meeting, it has been decided to revise the scope of exemption to exclude from it prepackaged and pre-labelled retail pack in terms of Legal Metrology Act, including pre-packed, pre-labelled curd, lassi and butter milk.\\n● With an objective to rationalise GST exemptions, the 47th GST Council Meeting recommended to withdraw GST exemption on items such as Cheques, lose or in book form, Maps and hydrographic or similar charts of all kinds, including atlases, wall maps, topographical plans and globes, printed. On similar lines, exemption in form of a concessional rate of GST is being rationalised on items such as Petroleum/ Coal bed methane, Scientific and technical instruments supplied to public funded research institutes, E-waste. \\nChanges in GST Law and Procedure:\\n● The following measures were undertaken for trade facilitation and ease of doing business under GST in 2022-23:\\nmeasures intended to facilitate trade: \\n● Retrospective amendment made in section 50 of CGST Act with effect from 01.7.2017 to provide the interest is required to be paid on the wrongly availed ITC only when the same has been availed as well as utilised. Also, rate of interest on wrongly availed and utilised ITC reduced to 18% from 24% with retrospective effect from 01.7.2017.\\n● Vide Notification No. 14/2022-Central Tax dated 5.7.2022, UPI & IMPS have been provided as an additional mode for payment of GST to facilitate taxpayers and to further encourage digital payment by amending Rule 87(3) of CGST Rules. This will provide them flexibility and case in making their GST payment.\\n● Transfer of CGST/IGST cash ledger balance has been allowed between \\'distinct persons\\' (entities having same PAN but registered in different states). Facility has been provided for withdrawal of refund applications made under GST by the taxpayers.\\n● Facility has been provided for withdrawal of refund applications made under GST by the taxpayers.\\n● In GST, a mechanism has been prescribed for refund of accumulated ITC on export of electricity.\\n● Procedure of sanction of IGST Refund in case of export of goods, where the exporters have been identified as risky, has been streamlined, to expedite verification and processing of such claims.\\nmeasures intended to improve ease of doing business:\\n● Threshold for mandatory issuance of e-invoice has been reduced to ₹10 crore from 01.10.2022.\\n● To facilitate small taxpayers in making supply of goods through e-commerce operators 77\\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\\n(ECO), and to provide parity in intra-state offline and online supply of goods, in-principle \\ndecision has been taken for waiver of requirement of mandatory registration under GST for intra-state supply of goods through ECO\\'s Composition taxpayers would also be allowed to make intra-State supply through ECOs subject to certain conditions. This will open the huge e-commerce market for the small taxpayers to sell their goods without getting mandatory registration which will boost small business. These changes would be notified in due course of time, as it would require amendment in GST provision, as per recommendations of GST Council, and technical change on portal and also by ECOs.CHAPTER04\\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, \\nafter nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. These \\ndevelopments led to an unprecedented, synchronous, and sharp cycle of monetary \\ntightening across countries. Major central banks have implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve’ s rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. \\nWhile the Federal Reserve has raised policy rates by 425 basis points (bps), the European \\nCentral Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) have implemented 300 bps and 250 bps rate increases, respectively. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in \\nApril 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 bps. Consequently, \\ndomestic financial conditions began to tighten, which was reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates.\\nThe change in RBI’ s policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity \\nconditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In \\nthe government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until \\nJune 2022 on concerns of high inflation and policy rate hikes. These yields moderated in November and December 2022, aided by lower crude oil prices, a slower pace of rate \\nhikes, and general moderation in global sovereign bond yields. \\nWhile the global tightening cycle has contributed to a dampened global outlook, the \\ndomestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled \\nCommercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022, with the \\nincrease being broad-based. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in \\nenhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets \\n(GNP A) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0 and well above the regulatory \\nrequirement of 11.5. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. The recovery \\nrate for the SCBs through Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was highest in FY22 compared to other channels.  \\nPolitical and economic developments in 2022 – the breakout of a conflict in Europe, \\nhigh inflation and raising interest rates - meant that capital markets around the world were characterised by increased volatility. However, domestic capital markets displayed \\nsome encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all \\nsegments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions Monetary ManageMent \\nand financial inter Mediation: a  good year79\\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\\nwhile primary private debt markets saw a growth in placements and resource mobilisation. \\nWhile secondary capital market indices of the Nifty 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex were \\nnot immune to the volatility in Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) flows, they performed \\nbetter than their peers between April and December 2022. Furthermore, net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a \\ndecreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this \\nperiod. Both developments underscore India’ s strong macroeconomic fundamentals and relatively buoyant demand outlook.\\nThe increasing outreach of the banking sector and capital markets is reflected in the \\ninsurance and pension sectors. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. \\nImportant government interventions and a conducive regulatory environment have \\nsupported the growth of the insurance market, which has seen increasing partnerships, product innovations, and vibrant distribution channels. India is poised to emerge as one \\nof the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector too has \\nbeen taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS), more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase \\nin the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). The expansion of \\nthe sector has been aided by government measures such as relaxation in CCS (Pension) Rules, integration of electronic Pension Payment Order (e-PPO) with DigiLocker, and \\nrelaxation in the timeline for submitting Digital Life Certificate.\\nAs global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph ‘higher-for-longer’ \\npolicy rates in their battle against inflation, monetary conditions are expected to remain \\ntight worldwide. Domestically, however, RBI’ s support to growth will ensure adequate \\nliquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle. The \\ncredit upcycle will also be aided by constant monitoring of the risks in the financial system \\nby the regulators and their efforts to contain them. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals will underpin the return of global capital flows to India once the fog of uncertainty lifts. \\nThe financial system will play a key role in realising the objectives of Amrit Kaal.\\nMonetary developments\\n4.1 Inflationary pressures dominated the global economic landscape in FY23. The build-up of \\nprice pressures occurring in tandem with the economic recovery in FY22 from the pandemic was \\nlong viewed as transient. It was expected to abate as supply chains normalised. The debate on said transience was put to rest by the conflict that erupted in Europe in February 2022. It resulted in commodity prices soaring and added significantly to the prevailing inflationary pressures. This development has triggered the current sharp and synchronous monetary tightening cycle.  Setting the context, this chapter will review India’s monetary developments and the performance of the financial system in the current financial year. It includes reviewing the monetary policy actions and their impact on system liquidity and evaluating the performance of the banking system, sectoral credit developments and various insolvency frameworks. Further, it looks into the capital market, insurance and pension sector developments.80\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n4.2 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained a status quo on the policy repo rate \\nbetween May 2020 and February 2022 after implementing a 115 basis points (bps) reduction \\nbetween March 2020 and May 2020. Retail inflation has crossed the upper limit of RBI’s tolerance band since January 2022. Sensing a serious risk to price stability, RBI initiated the monetary tightening cycle. In its April 2022 meeting, the committee introduced the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF), which allowed for the deposit of excess funds by banks with the RBI without the necessity of collateral in the form of government securities, thereby allowing effective liquidity management in a collateral-free manner. Here, it is worth mentioning that while the SDF window is available for overnight deposits, the Reserve Bank retains the flexibility to absorb surplus liquidity of longer tenors under the window, if necessary, with appropriate pricing. The SDF, introduced at a rate of 3.75 per cent, replaced the reverse repo rate as the new floor of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor. The MPC also indicated a change in stance from ‘Accommodative’ to ‘Accommodative and focused on the withdrawal of accommodation, while supporting growth’ in this meeting, signalling the start of the monetary tightening cycle.\\nfigure iV .1: Policy rates\\n2.53.54.55.56.57.5\\nFeb- 20\\nApr-20\\nJun- 20\\nAug- 20\\nO ct -20\\nDe c-20\\nFeb- 21\\nApr-21\\nJun- 21\\nAug- 21\\nO ct -21\\nDe c-21\\nFeb- 22\\nApr-22\\nJun- 22\\nAug- 22\\nO ct -22\\nDe c-22Per centFixed Reverse repo rate Repo rate  SDF rate MSF rate\\nSource: RBI\\n4.3 Recognising the sizeable upside risk imparted by adverse global developments, such as \\nthe generalised hardening of commodity prices and an increased likelihood of prolonged supply \\nchain disruptions, the MPC convened an off-cycle meeting in May 2022. Members unanimously voted for an increase of 40 bps each in the policy repo rate, the SDF and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF), and a 50 bps increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). Between May 2022 and December 2022 and over five meetings, the MPC implemented a cumulative hike of 225 bps each in the policy repo rate, the SDF, the MSF and the bank rate. In the initial phases of the tightening cycle, the committee noted that commodity price-driven inflationary pressures, increased volatility and initial signs of a slowdown in output characterised the global outlook. In its latest meeting of December 5-7 2022, the MPC hiked the policy repo rate by 35 bps, and reiterated its focus on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.  81\\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\\n4.4 Reserve money (M0) increased by 10.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) as on 30th  December \\n2022 compared to 13 per cent last year. However, reserve money adjusted for the first-round \\nimpact of changes in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) recorded a YoY growth of 7.8 per cent compared to 9.1 per cent a year ago. On the component side, growth in Currency in Circulation (CIC) broadly remained stable at levels seen after Covid-19, barring a marginal increase in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which can be attributed to a rise in precautionary holdings. So far, expansion in M0 during FY23 was mainly driven by bankers’ deposits with the RBI, with an increase in the CRR.\\ntable iV .1: yoy growth in monetary aggregates (in per cent)\\nitem fy17^ fy18 fy19 fy20 fy21 fy22 fy23*\\n1. reserve Money (M0) -12.9 27.3 14.5 9.4 18.8 13.0 10.3\\n1.a.

From \\nthe component side, aggregate deposits have been the largest component and contributed most \\nto the expansion of M3 during the year so far. Amongst sources, bank credit to the commercial sector drove the expansion of broad money, and net bank credit to the government supplemented this expansion. Of significance is the increase in the share of bank credit to the commercial sector in M3 to 64.3 per cent as on 30th December 2022 from 61.1 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting the upswing in the credit disbursal by commercial banks.\\n4.6 The money multiplier – the ratio of M3 and M0 – has broadly remained stable at an \\naverage of 5.1 over April – December 2022 period compared to 5.2 in the corresponding period \\nof the previous year. However, M0 adjusted for reverse repo, which is analytically akin to banks’ deposits with the RBI, was much higher until April 2022. Hence, the adjusted money multiplier was lower at 4.3 at the beginning of FY23. M0 adjusted for the reverse repo is now much closer to M0; hence, as on 30 December 2022, the money multiplier and adjusted money multiplier stood at 5.21 and 5.03, respectively. \\nliquidity conditions\\n4.7 Surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed post-Covid-19 in response to the Reserve Bank’s \\nconventional and unconventional monetary measures moderated during FY23 in consonance with the changed monetary policy stance that focused on the withdrawal of accommodation. With the MSF rate retained at 25 bps above the policy repo rate, the LAF corridor became symmetric around the policy repo rate - the corridor width was thus restored to 50 bps, the position that prevailed before the pandemic. The RBI’s move to hike the CRR by 50 bps resulted in a withdrawal of primary liquidity to the tune of ₹87,000 crore from the banking system.\\nliquidity conditions moderating\\nfigure iV .3a: gradual withdrawal of  \\nsurplus liquidityfigure iV .3b: overnight call money rates  \\nnow trending well inside laf  corridor\\n-11357\\n01-Apr-22\\n22-Apr-22\\n13-May-22\\n03-Jun-2224-Jun-22\\n15-Jul-22\\n05-Aug-22\\n26-Aug-22\\n16-Sep-22\\n07-Oct-2228-Oct-22\\n18-Nov-22\\n09-Dec-22\\n30-Dec-22₹ lakh croreNe t LAF\\nDa ily SDF\\nVariable Rate Reverse Repo\\nMSF\\n34567\\n01-Apr-22\\n22-Apr-22\\n13-May-22\\n03-Jun-2224-Jun-22\\n15-Jul-22\\n05-Aug-2226-Aug-22\\n16-Sep-22\\n07-Oct-2228-Oct-22\\n18-Nov-22\\n09-Dec-22\\n30-Dec-22Per centWeighted average call rate\\nFixed Reverse repo rate\\nRepo rate\\n SDF rate\\nMSF rate\\nSource: RBI83\\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\\n4.8 The daily net liquidity absorption averaged ₹2.5 lakh crore during FY23 (up to 21 December \\n2022) as compared with ₹6.7 lakh crore in FY22. The Reserve Bank remained nimble and agile \\nin liquidity management by conducting two-way operations. It injected liquidity to assuage transient liquidity tightness through two variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of ₹50,000 crore each of 3 days and overnight maturity on 26th July and 22nd September 2022, respectively. The gradual withdrawal of surplus liquidity pushed the weighted average call rate (WACR) – the operating target of monetary policy – closer to the policy repo rate, on an average basis. The WACR traded 6 bps above the policy repo rate, on an average, during H2 (up to 21 December 2022) compared to 28 bps below it during H1. Interest rates on various money market rates - 91-day Treasury Bills (T-Bills), 3-month certificates of deposit and commercial papers - gradually firmed up in line with the increase in the repo rate.\\nMonetary Policy transmission\\n4.9 Lending and deposit rates of banks increased during FY23 in consonance with the policy \\nrepo rate changes.

Lower slippages and the reduction in outstanding GNPAs through recoveries, upgrades and write-offs led to this decrease. Lower GNPAs, combined with high provisions accumulated in recent years, contributed to a decline in NNPA.  There was a broad-based improvement in the GNPA ratio in the industrial sector, though it remained elevated for gems and jewellery and construction sub-sectors. Going ahead, as per the baseline scenario of the RBI’s stress testing framework, the declining tendency in the GNPA ratio is likely to continue and is projected to drop further to 4.9 per cent in March 2023.\\nfigure iV .7: Broad-based improvement in the gnP a ratio\\n024681012\\nAgriculture (23.0%) Industry (37.1%) Services (28.2%) Personal Loans (11.7%)Per centMar-21 Sep- 21 Mar-22 Sep- 22\\nSource: RBI\\nNote: Numbers in brackets with the legend represents share of the respective sector’s GNPA in total GNPA of SCBs as of Sept 2022.87\\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\\n4.16 Moreover, with shrinking GNPAs, the Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) has been \\nincreasing steadily since March 2021 and reached 71.6 per cent in September 2022.

With a pick-up in lending activity during H1:FY23, CRAR moderated in September 2022 because of an increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs). However, it remains well above the minimum capital requirement, including Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) requirements of 11.5 per cent.\\nfigure iV .8: capital adequacy ratio well above the requirement norms\\n0510152025\\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-20 Mar-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\\n Source: RBI\\n4.17 During the first half of FY23, the profitability of SCBs, measured in terms of Return \\non Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA), improved to levels last observed in FY15. At \\nthe system level, Profit After Tax (PAT) witnessed a double-digit growth of 40.7 per cent in the quarter ending September 2022, led by strong growth in Net Interest Income (NII) and a significant lowering of provisions. Macro-stress tests conducted by RBI for credit risk reveal that SCBs are well-capitalised and that all banks would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under adverse stress scenarios.\\nconsistent improvement in Performance indicators\\nfigure iV .9a: roe- annualised figure iV .9b: roa-annualised\\n0481216\\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-21 Sep-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\\n0.00.40.81.21.62.0\\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-21 Sep-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\\nSource: RBI88\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nCredit Growth Aided by a Sound Banking System and Deleveraged Corporate \\nSector\\n4.18 The recovery in economic activity in FY22, along with the enhanced financial soundness \\nof banks and corporates, has bolstered the expansion of non-food bank credit since June 2021. \\nThe YoY growth in non-food bank credit accelerated to 15.3 per cent in December 2022.

An increase in demand for housing induces \\ngreater investment which, in turn, sets off a virtuous cycle of growth and investment. Credit to agriculture and allied activities gained momentum supported by the Government’s concessional institutional credit and higher agricultural credit target. Industrial credit growth has been buoyed by a pick-up in credit to MSMEs, assisted by the benefits accrued from the effective 89\\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\\nimplementation of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and the support \\nprovided by the government’s production-linked incentive scheme and improvement in capacity utilisation. Credit growth in services was driven by a recovery in credit to NBFCs, commercial real estate and trade sectors.\\n4.20 With moderation in overseas issuances and lower investments by Private Equity (PE)/\\nVenture Capital (VC), the financing needs of the corporate sector are being met through domestic \\nresources.  As funds raised from the primary segment of domestic equity markets declined during FY23, reliance on bank credit for funding regular operations and capacity expansion increased. Also, the Incremental Credit-Deposit ratio rose sharply both on an annual (122.0 per cent, YoY) and half-yearly basis (172.5 per cent; September 2022 over March 2022). The accumulation of deposits in the past few years has enabled banks to fund the growing credit demand. Here, the well-capitalised banking system with a low NPA ratio and more robust corporate sector fundamentals will continue to enhance the flow of bank credit into productive investment opportunities, notwithstanding the rising interest rates.\\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) Continue to Recover\\n4.21 The growing importance of the NBFC sector in the Indian financial system is reflected \\nin the consistent rise of NBFCs’ credit as a proportion to GDP as well as in relation to credit extended by SCBs. Supported by various policy initiatives, NBFCs could absorb the shocks of the pandemic. They built up financial soundness during FY22, marked by balance sheet consolidation, improvement in asset quality, augmented capital buffers and profitability.\\nfigure iV .12: increasing credit disbursed to and by nBfcs\\n0123456\\n05101520253035\\nFY13 FY15 FY17 FY19 FY21 H1:FY23\\nPer cent₹ Lakh CroreAggregate Credit by NBFCs Credit to NBFCs (% of G DP, RHS)\\nSource: RBI\\nNote: Credit to NBFCs (per cent of GDP) for FY23 (H1) is estimated based on NSO’s 1st AE for FY23 and credit by NBFCs as of September 2022.\\n4.22 The continuous improvement in asset quality is seen in the declining GNPA ratio of \\nNBFCs from the peak of 7.2 per cent recorded during the second wave of the pandemic (June \\n2021) to 5.9 per cent in September 2022, reaching close to the pre-pandemic level.

The fear of losing control over the CD upon initiation of CIRP \\nhas nudged thousands of debtors to settle their dues even before the initiation of insolvency proceedings.

Despite the very low value \\nof the distressed firms to begin with, 69 per cent of distressed assets were rescued by the Code. \\nOverall, in terms of value realisation for initiators of CIRPs (which includes Financial Creditors, Operational Creditors and Corporate Debtors), the resolution plans realised ₹2.4 lakh crore, which is 177.6 per cent of the liquidation value and 84\\n1 per cent of the fair value of the 553 CDs \\nrescued. Moreover, realisation by financial creditors under resolution plans in comparison to liquidation value was 201 per cent, while the realisation by them was 33 per cent of their claims. \\n92 per cent of the value realised under the liquidation Process\\n4.29 1807 CDs ended up with orders for liquidation as of September 2022. These CDs assets \\nwere valued at less than 8 per cent of the aggregate claim amount on the ground. However, \\nmore than 76 per cent of the CIRPs ending in liquidation (1349 out of 1774 for which data are available) were earlier with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and/ or are defunct. The economic value of most of the corporate debtors that ended in liquidation had almost completely eroded even before they were admitted into CIRP. 429 CDs have been completely liquidated. The Code has facilitated the realisation of 92 per cent of the value through the liquidation of these companies.\\nTable IV .4: Rescue of distressed assets as on 30th September  (Amount in ₹ crore)\\nrescue of distressed assetscompanies \\nrescued by \\nresolutioncompanies \\nordered for \\nliquidationtotal\\nNo. of Companies 553 1807 2360\\nAggregate Claims 7,90,626 8,28,180 16,18,806\\nLiquidation Value 1,37,119 60,143 1,97,261\\nAssets available as % of \\nAggregate Claims17.3 7.3 12.19\\nResolution Value 2,43,452 NA 2,43,452\\nResolution Value as % of \\nLiquidation Value177.6 NA NA\\nResolution Value as % of Aggregate Claims30.8 NA NA\\nAverage time taken 561 days 437 days NA\\nCost % of Resolution Value 0.6 NA NA\\nSource: IBBI\\n1  Based on 456 cases where fair values have been estimated94\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n2  Section 9.2.2 Mode of Sale https://ibbi.gov.in/uploads/publication/e42fddce80e99d28b683a7e21c81110e.pdf\\n3  Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India for the year ended March 31, 2022NPAs: IBC recovers highest amount for Scheduled Commercial Banks\\n4.30 As per the RBI data, in FY 22, the total amount recovered by SCBs under IBC has been \\nthe highest compared to other channels such as Lok Adalat’s, SARFAESI Act and DRTs in this \\nperiod.\\n4.31 In a public auction-based resolution model2 such as the IBC, the extent of the haircut \\nrepresents the discount the market demands for acquiring the stressed entity as a going concern. \\nSince significant value destruction may have already happened in these assets, a comparison of realised value with admitted claims may not be a reasonable indicator of the effectiveness of the resolution process.

While \\ncrypto assets were apparently designed to disintermediate traditional financial services, this has \\ncreated new unregulated intermediating entities. The promise of decentralisation haslso yet to be realised in practice. New centralised intermediaries, such as crypto asset exchanges, wallet providers, \\nand crypto conglomerates, require users to trust centralised entities.

The underlying protocols used to create crypto assets may also conflict \\nwith other public policy objectives, for instance, the massive energy intensity of “mining” crypto assets.\\nThere are minimal global standards applicable to unbacked crypto assets, which do not currently \\nmitigate all risks and vulnerabilities. Even as Standard-Setting Bodies (SSBs) have been making efforts to adjust and develop standards, these remain mainly focused on specific issues (financial integrity), \\nsectors (payments, securities and banking), products (global stablecoins), or entities designated as \\nsystemic by domestic authorities. Thus, there are regulatory gaps at each stage when crypto assets \\nare issued, transferred, exchanged, or stored by non-bank entities. Crypto’s cross-sector and cross-\\nborder nature limits the effectiveness of uncoordinated national approaches. The terminology used to describe the different activities, products, and stakeholders is not globally harmonised. The term \\n“crypto asset” itself refers to a broad spectrum of digital products that may need the attention of \\nmultiple domestic regulators based on their actual or intended use. There is a range of crypto actors, such as miners, validators, and protocol developers, that may not be easily covered by traditional financial regulation (Narain & Moretti, 2022).\\nA few case studies\\n7 of countries and jurisdictions attempting to regulate unbacked crypto assets are \\ndiscussed below:\\n\\uf06c       european Union: The European Union’s digital finance strategy comprises regulating Markets \\nin Crypto Assets (MiCA).

Further amendments to the law were made in May 2019 and June 2020 to extend crypto regulation to other entities, such as wallet \\nservice providers, limit the leverage provided to retail customers by crypto asset exchanges, \\nand introduce regulations for security tokens and stablecoins, respectively.

Following significant consumer research on the crypto asset market, the UK Treasury set out its roadmap for crypto asset regulation \\nin April 2022, focusing on stablecoins and a proposal for a sandbox regime for blockchain-based \\nFMIs. Regarding regulating crypto asset promotions, the UK Crypto Assets Taskforce\\n8  published \\na report in 2018 that found that misleading advertising (overstating benefits and rarely warning \\nretail investors of volatility and risks) and lack of suitable information were vital consumer \\nprotection issues in crypto-asset markets. In January 2022, the UK Treasury proposed bringing crypto assets within its Financial Promotions Regime, subjecting crypto asset promotions to \\nthe same high standards as for other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance \\nproducts. Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published guidelines to restrict the \\nmarketing of crypto assets in Singapore in January 2022, limiting crypto asset promotions to an \\nentity’s corporate website, official social media accounts, and mobile applications.\\n\\uf06c     albania: Albania’s law on “DLT-based Financial Markets” (also known as the “Fintoken Act”) \\nlegalised crypto assets in Albania for investment purposes in May 2020.

Setting up and operationalising India’s \\nmaiden International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City is the most important one. The aim is to facilitate India to emerge as a significant economic power by accelerating the development of a strong base of International Financial Services in the country. Box 2 below discusses the key role that IFSC can play in facilitating India’s emergence as a preferred jurisdiction for international financial services and encouraging easier access and greater participation from foreign investors to bring in capital to further promote India’s growth.\\nBox iV .2: gift  ifSc - emerging as a Preferred Jurisdiction \\nfor international financial Services\\nGlobally, International Financial Centres (IFCs) have assumed prominence in the financial services \\necosystem primarily because they have contributed enormously to the growth of international \\nfinancial transactions. These centres have played a pivotal role in accelerating the pace of financial \\nglobalisation. In common parlance, an IFC is a jurisdiction with a high concentration of financial institutions such as Banks, Stock Markets & related entities, Insurance firms, Fund Managers, \\nFinTech firms, etc., which offer specialised financial services to non-residents and residents, in an \\nenvironment that promotes financial innovation and facilitates cross border transactions.\\nGiven this backdrop, setting up and operationalising India’s maiden IFSC in GIFT City has been \\na path-breaking financial reform underpinning India’s increasingly liberal outlook towards capital \\naccount convertibility. GIFT-IFSC is housed in India’s first fully operational Smart City with world-class commercial, social and physical infrastructure. To bolster the development of IFSC, the \\nGovernment took a major policy decision to establish the first of its kind, unified and agile financial \\nsector regulator for IFSCs viz International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) through an Act of Parliament in 2019. From 1st October 2020, IFSCA assumed the power of four domestic sector \\nregulators, namely RBI, SEBI, IRDAI & Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of \\nIndia (PFRDAI), in so far as the development and regulation of IFSCs in India were concerned.  \\nOver the last two years, GIFT-IFSC has witnessed tremendous growth and traction across the entire \\nspectrum of financial services, including banking, capital markets, insurance, fund management, \\naircraft leasing, etc. With an internationally aligned regulatory regime, competitive tax structure and \\nbeneficial cost of operations, GIFT IFSC is now emerging as a preferred jurisdiction for international financial services. Recognising the growing significance of IFSC, the Global Financial Centres Index, \\nLondon Report (March 2022) put IFSC in GIFT City at the top, among 15 centres globally, which is \\nlikely to become more significant over the next 2 to 3 years.\\nGIFT IFSC has more than 390 + entities registered across a full spectrum of financial services, \\nincluding Banks, Capital Markets, Insurance, FinTech, Aircraft Leasing, Bullion Exchange, etc. \\nThe financial services market is rapidly growing with the healthy and increasing participation of international and domestic financial institutions. \\nrecent developments/milestones/innovations/collaborations with other countries\\nIn pursuit of its vision to become an international financial centre of global stature, IFSCA has \\ncontinuously engaged in deliberations with many globally prominent financial authorities and \\nstandard-setting bodies.

It marks a decade of India’s maiden IFSC. The vision plan beyond \\n2022 revolves around elevating GIFT-IFSC to a virtuous self-sustaining trajectory towards becoming \\nthe nerve centre of new-age global financial services and activities. This aspirational pursuit of integrating our economy with the global financial ecosystem has been rich in learnings which are \\nbeing systematically capitalised to design cutting-edge statutory and regulatory frameworks to lift the \\ncentre into a higher orbit of financial innovation and dynamism. \\nWithin years of its establishment, GIFT-IFSC has become a prominent gateway for the flow of global \\ncapital into India. Significant gains have been made in kickstarting experimental and innovative \\nfinancial services such as bullion trading, aircraft and ship leasing, global-in house centres, Fintech, sustainable financing and cross-border bill discounting and factoring. Sophisticated financial products \\nsuch as Bullion Depository Receipts, unsponsored Depository Receipts, and financial and operational \\nleases have been introduced, with many more in the pipeline. State-of-the-art infrastructure has been created for wholesome quality of life with essential projects including metro connectivity, integrated \\nresidential projects, Central Park, Riverfront and recreational centres on the anvil.\\nThe foundation has been laid for creating a thriving knowledge economy by allowing foreign \\nuniversities to set up operations in IFSC free of domestic regulations. Simultaneously, external assistance is mobilised to establish India’s premier Fintech Institute and Innovation Centre in GIFT \\nCity. The Centre, with an estimated cost of ₹800 crore, will underpin India’s growing stature and \\nleadership in Fintech and attract the best of talent globally.\\nSignificantly, the Government’s vision for GIFT-IFSC transcends much beyond traditional finance \\nand ventures into thought leadership. It is envisioned as the embodiment of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, a \\nhub of ingenuity and innovation. As we advance, the vision entails a quantum leap in imagination and \\nendeavours to transform GIFT City into a bustling financial hub, a vibrant city bearing a distinctively \\ninternational character and pioneering solutions to complex problem statements involving finance.109\\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\\nDevelopments in the Insurance Market\\nInsurance markets globally have demonstrated remarkable flexibility and resilience in \\novercoming the impact of the pandemic\\n4.51 Insurance, an integral part of the financial sector, plays a significant role in economic \\ndevelopment.

In 2021, total global insurance premiums grew by 3.4 per cent in real terms, with the non-life insurance sector registering 2.6 per cent growth, driven by rate hardening in commercial lines in developed markets. However, in China, the largest emerging market, non-life premium volumes contracted by 0.7 per cent as the de-tariffication\\n11 of motor insurance sparked fierce \\ncompetition and rate reductions. \\nfigure iV .25a: Per cent change in volume of \\nlife-insurance premiums in 2021figure iV .25b: Per cent change in volume of \\nnon-life insurance premiums in 2021\\n4.55.46.7612.5\\nWorldAdvanced EconomiesEmerging Economies\\n(excluding China)OECDEurozone\\n2.62.94.12.91.2\\nWorldAdvanced EconomiesEmerging Economies\\n(excluding China)OECDEurozone\\nSource: Swiss Re, Sigma various issues\\n4.53 In the life insurance segment, global premium growth bounced back strongly, registering \\nan increase of 4.5 per cent. The US remained the largest insurance market in the world, with total premiums (non-life and life) of US$ 2.8 trillion in 2021, followed by China and Japan. With the conflict in Ukraine weighing on economic growth in Europe in particular, it is expected that insurance industry growth in emerging markets will outpace that in the developed markets this year, with emerging Asia in the lead. \\n11   De-tariffication means removing the tariff structure. This allows insurance companies to charge premiums that matches the risk profiles \\nof its consumers. Different insurance companies can charge at a different price to its consumers for the same risk behaviour based on their business risks models and strategies.110\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nIndia poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade\\n4.54 Insurance penetration in India increased steadily from 2.7 per cent around the turn of the \\nmillennium to 4.2 per cent in 2020 and remained the same in 2021. Life insurance penetration in \\nIndia was 3.2 per cent in 2021, almost twice more than the emerging markets and slightly above the global average. However, most life insurance products sold in India are savings-linked, with just a small protection component. Hence, households remain exposed to a significant financing gap in the event of the premature death of the primary breadwinner. Be that as it may, the insurance density in India has increased from US$ 11.1 in 2001 to US$ 91 in 2021 (density for Life insurance was US$ 69 and Non-Life insurance was US$ 22 in 2021) in keeping with the relatively faster expansion of the insurance market in the country. \\n4.55 During FY22, the gross direct premium of non-Life insurers (within and outside India) \\nregistered YoY growth of 10.8 per cent, primarily driven by health and motor segments. The net \\nincurred claims of non-Life insurers stood at ₹1.4 lakh crore in FY22, primarily driven by rising per capita income, product innovations and customisation, development of strong distribution channels, and rising financial literacy. The life insurance premium registered YoY growth of 10.2 per cent in FY22, with new businesses contributing 45.5 per cent of the total premiums received by the life insurers. The life insurance industry paid beneﬁts of ₹5.02 lakh crore in FY22, out of which 8.3 per cent benefits were on death claims.\\nfigure iV .26a: Steady increase in \\ninsurance PenetrationFigure IV .26b: Significant rise in \\ninsurance density\\n0.60.70.80.911.1\\n22.42.83.23.6\\n2012-13\\n2013-14\\n2014-152015-16\\n2016-17\\n2017-182018-19\\n2019-20\\n2020-212021-22\\nPer centPer centLife Insurance Non-Life Insurance (RHS)\\n510152025\\n304050607080\\n2012-13\\n2013-14\\n2014-15\\n2015-16\\n2016-17\\n2017-18\\n2018-19\\n2019-20\\n2020-21\\n2021-22\\nUS$ US$ Life-Insurance Non-Life Insurance (RHS)\\nSource: Swiss Re, Sigma various issues\\n4.56 Public listings improve public disclosure, corporate governance, and valuation12. In \\nkeeping with this understanding, India’s largest life insurer, the Life Insurance Corporation of \\nIndia, went public in May 2022, raising US$ 2.7 billion in the country’s largest IPO to date. The private insurance providers have also been seizing such opportunities. The largest private-sector health insurer in the country, was listed in December 2021, making it the fifth private-sector insurer to IPO. The insurance sector is highly competitive and is already witnessing mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity as insurers have tremendous opportunities and volume to co-\\n12  https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=3619111\\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\\nexist in the space. Additional FDI inflows, IPOs, simplified rules & regulations and improved \\ncorporate valuations will likely further accelerate M&A activities in the sector. A rapidly maturing insurance market has provided a lucrative opportunity to the government to privatize its stake in insurance business. Accordingly, the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Act, 2021 allows the central government to pare its stake to less than 51 per cent of the equity capital in a specified insurer. \\n4.57 To facilitate the penetration of insurance to the lower income segments of the population, \\nthe Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued IRDAI (Micro \\nInsurance) Regulations, 2015, which provide a platform for distributing insurance products that are affordable for the rural and urban poor and promote financial inclusion. Further, the IRDAI (Obligations of Insurers to Rural and Social Sectors) Regulations, 2015 stipulate obligations for insurers in rural and social sectors and has contributed to developing and promoting micro-insurance products in India. In FY21, 10.7 lakh new micro-insurance policies were issued to individuals with a new business premium of ₹355.3 crore (in the life-insurance segment), and 53,046 new microinsurance policies were issued in the general insurance segment (excluding standalone health insurers).\\n4.58 Government schemes and financial inclusion initiatives have driven insurance adoption \\nand penetration across all segments. The government’s flagship initiative for crop insurance, \\nPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), has led to significant growth in the premium income for crop insurance. Ayushman Bharat (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) (AB PM-JAY) aims at providing a health cover of ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation. The insurance regulator IRDAI has also undertaken various initiatives towards boosting insurance penetration, such as permitting insurers to conduct video-based Know Your Customer (KYC), launching standardised insurance products, and allowing insurers to offer rewards for low-risk behaviour. Important government initiatives, strong demographic factors, a conducive regulatory environment, increased M&As, product innovations, and vibrant distribution channels are supporting the insurance market\\'s growth. \\nA list of various Government Insurance schemes and progress made so far is given in the table \\nbelow:\\ntable iV .16: government insurance schemes and progress\\nScheme name Brief description achievement \\nAyushman Bharat Yojana The scheme provides health coverage of ₹5 lakh per beneficiary family per annum to poor and vulnerable families identified based on select deprivation and occupational criteriaSince inception, 19.7 crore beneficiaries have been provided Ayushman cards, and over 4.3 crore hospital admissions worth over ₹0.49 lakh crore have been authorised through a network of 28,667 empanelled health-care providers, including 13,115 private hospitals as of 20th January 2023.112\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nPradhan Mantri Suraksha \\nBima YojanaUnder the scheme, risk \\ncoverage of ₹2 lakh for accidental death and complete disability and ₹1 lakh for partial disability is given to beneficiariesSince its inception, 31.3 crore beneficiaries have been enrolled under the scheme, and 1.07 lakh claims have been disbursed as of 30th November 2022.\\nPradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti \\nBima YojanaUnder the scheme, risk \\ncoverage of ₹2 Lakh is \\ncredited to the savings bank \\naccount of the holder in case of the death of the insuredSince its inception, 14.4 \\ncrore beneficiaries have been \\nenrolled under the scheme, \\nand 6.3 lakh claims have been disbursed as of 30th November 2022.\\nPradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana \\nYojanaUnder the scheme, old age \\nincome security is provided to senior citizens through the provision of an assured pension/return linked to the subscription amount based on a government guarantee to LIC A total number of 8.6 lakh subscribers with a subscription amount of ₹84,659.4 crore deposited by these subscribers have benefited under the scheme as of 30th September 2022\\nPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima \\nYojanaUnder the scheme, risk \\ninsurance is provided to \\nfarmers against crop damage \\ndue to non-preventable natural \\nrisks from pre-sowing to post-harvest for the crops/areas \\nnotified by the concerned \\nState GovernmentDuring 2016 and 2022, \\n2763.9 lakh applications were \\nreceived under the scheme, \\nand claims of about ₹ 1.28 \\nlakh crore have been paid to the farmers.\\nSource: DFS, PIB, PMFBY Dashboard\\n4.59 Global life premiums are expected to contract slightly in 2022 after last year’s robust \\nrecovery from pandemic-induced lows driven by inflationary pressures, economic uncertainty, \\nand monetary tightening. Saving premiums are expected to decline due to volatility in the financial markets and as disposable incomes fall.

Many digital platforms have emerged over recent years, offering various services, \\nincluding insurance purchases. These measures, accompanied by an increase in FDI limit for \\nInsurance Companies, are likely to facilitate an increased flow of long-term capital, global \\ntechnology, processes, and international best practices, which will support the growth of India’s \\ninsurance sector.\\nPension Sector\\nIndia’s Pension Sector demonstrated remarkable performance during the Covid-19\\n4.62 The framework of the pension system has evolved globally. In advanced countries, the \\npension sector is substantial, partly stemming from a large share of formal salaried employment. \\nWhile the state provides some basic pension, it is only sometimes funded and thus is a pay-as-you-go scheme relying on current government revenue for pension payments. In 2021, pension assets in OECD countries\\n14  stood at US$ 38.5 trillion, 66.9 per cent of the GDP. In some of the \\nOECD countries, pension assets were over 100 per cent of the GDP. The United States recorded \\nthe largest holdings in pension funds, followed by the United Kingdom and Australia. During \\nCovid-19, countries undertook unprecedented and swift health and pension-related reforms15 to \\naddress health challenges, limit the impact of the crisis on labour markets, support incomes and \\nadjust macroeconomic p olicies.\\n4.63 In addition, countries took other measures to minimise the impact of Covid-19 on the \\nmarginalised, poor and vulnerable sections such as subsidising wages and pension entitlements \\nthrough Job Retention Scheme (JRS), broadening the access to unemployment benefits, or grant of unemployment insurance to new groups of workers. The United States expanded the \\ncoverage of unemployment benefits to the self-employed and Finland broadened the coverage \\nof the already existing scheme for the self-employed. Chile permanently expanded the coverage of unemployment insurance to workers. New Zealand introduced a temporary benefit paid for \\nup to three months to employees who lost their jobs and to the self-employed who stopped their \\nactivity.\\n4.64 The Government of India announced various measures to provide pensions to families who \\nhave lost their earning members due to Covid. It also took initiatives towards enhancing and \\nliberalising insurance compensation. The benefit of the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) pension scheme was extended to even those who have lost earning members due to \\nCovid-19. Dependent family members of such persons were entitled to a pension equivalent \\nto 90 per cent of the average daily wage drawn by the worker as per the existing norms. The insurance benefits under the Employees Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) scheme were also enhanced and liberalised. \\n4.65 Ex-gratia of ₹1,000 was given to around three crore poor senior citizens, widows, and \\ndisabled sections of the population (aged above 60 years) for three months during April-June \\n2020. Rule 64 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, was relaxed to ensure immediate provisional sanction of pensionary benefits amid the unprecedented pandemic. To enhance the “Ease of 114\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nLiving” of Central Government Civil Pensioners, an Electronic Pension Payment order (e-PPO) \\nwas integrated with Digi Locker, creating a permanent PPO record in the Digi Locker. The timeline for submitting Life Certificate was relaxed, along with providing a doorstep facility to pensioners for submission of the life certificate digitally.\\n4.66 The Government of India is implementing various pension schemes such as the Indira \\nGandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS), Indira Gandhi National Widow \\nPension Scheme (IGNWPS), Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) with a total beneficiary coverage of 4.7 crore. The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced in January 2004, the primary pension system for government employees with a pay-as-you-go defined benefit plan. NPS for government employees is a defined contribution plan with co-contribution from the government. The value of the pension corpus is marked-to-market, and accordingly, the rate of return is market determined. NPS was extended to all the citizens of the country in the age group of 18-70 years, including the unorganised sector workers (on a voluntary basis) in 2009. In order to ensure that an avenue for savings is available to all sections of society, PFRDA launched “NPS-Corporate Sector Model” in 2011 to provide NPS to the employees of corporate entities, including PSUs.\\n4.67 The Government introduced APY in June 2015 as a part of the overarching objective of \\nproviding universal social security. The scheme applies to all individuals aged 18-40 years, \\nwith an emphasis on underprivileged, unorganised, and low-income individuals. Since the introduction of NPS and, more recently, APY , India\\'s pension sector has expanded. The total number of subscribers under the NPS and APY registered a YoY growth of 25.1 per cent in November 2022, with AuM witnessing a growth of 22.7 per cent during the same period. The overall contribution recorded an increase of 27.6 per cent in November 2022, with maximum growth registered by the All-Citizen model followed by the Corporate Sector. \\ntable iV .17: Performance of india’s Pension Sector\\n no. of \\nSubscribers yoycontribution \\n(₹ Crore)yoyaUM \\n(₹ Crore)yoy\\nNov-\\n21Nov-\\n22per \\ncentNov-21 Nov-22per \\ncentNov-21 Nov-22per \\ncent\\nCG+SG 77 83 8 3,93,690 4,89,855 24 5,55,932 6,67,255 20\\nCorporate+All Citizen32 42 31 8,41,80 1,19,817 42 1,07,554 1,46,705 36\\nAPY 325 429 32 16,877 22,437 33 19,352 24,829 28\\nSource: PFRDA\\nNote: CG stands for Central Government and SG for State Government\\n4.68 A survey by PFRDA16 on the socio-economic characteristics of NPS subscribers (all \\ncitizen models) for the five-year period FY17 to FY21 showed that 24 per cent were female \\nsubscribers, with the balance 76 per cent being male subscribers.

Among \\nvarious states, enrolment from Maharashtra was the highest, accounting for 17 per cent. The age \\nprofile of the subscribers in the APY scheme suggests increasing enrolments at younger age. As of August 2022, 44.8 per cent subscribers were between 18 and 25 years, as compared to 29.3 per cent as on March 2016\\n18. Further, more people are now opting for a pension amount of \\n₹1000 per month. As of March 2022, around 76 per cent of subscribers have opted for ₹1000 per month pension amount, as compared to 38 per cent of subscribers as on March 2016. However, the number of subscribers opting for ₹5000 per month pension has declined from 47 per cent as of March 2016 to 15 per cent as of March 2022. The coverage of the population in pension under NPS and APY as a share of the total population has raised from 1.2 per cent to 3.7 per cent during the six years FY17 to FY22. Assets as a proportion of GDP have increased from 1.2 per cent to 3.2 per cent, reflecting that the pension sector is progressing much faster than the nominal growth of the economy and population.\\n4.69 PFRDA has undertaken various measures to ease the accessibility of NPS and APY \\nto subscribers, such as reducing timelines for processing settlements to T+2 days. Central \\nRecordkeeping Agencies have integrated their systems with DigiLocker to provide Subscriber Centric Services such as electronic-Pension Retirement Account Number (e-PRAN), electronic Account statements, and Aadhar & DigiLocker-based account openings. Government sector subscribers can change their investment choices online by submitting the request directly in the CRA login. The contributions through the UPI handle can be accepted for the benefit of NPS subscribers, permitting them to remit funds into their PRAN via the Virtual account number provided by CRA.\\n4.70 There is tremendous scope for growth in India’s pension sector as per capita income is \\nexpected to rise further as the economy transitions to a high-middle-income country. India’s \\ndemographic structure, with a more significant proportion of younger people, favours a phase of accumulation. However, financial literacy is a significant challenge not only in emerging market economies but also in advanced economies. PFRDA, under the aegis of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), has taken several steps to enhance financial education so that consumers can make informed decisions and reap the benefit of the formal financial sector while being cognizant of risks and various trade-offs involved. These include pension education through print and electronic media, outreach programs through trade bodies, intermediaries such as banks, and town hall events.\\n4.71 India’s pension sector provides a flexible mode of old age income-security for salaried \\nemployees and the common person. In the recent five years, FY18 to FY22, the number of \\nsubscribers has multiplied over three-fold, led by APY , and AUM by over four-fold, led by NPS. The future expansion in NPS is expected to emanate from the private sector, both the salaried and self-employed. Steps towards enhanced pension literacy, both of the subscribers and the intermediaries, coupled with a nudge from the regulator and the government, along with encouragement to young adults to join a pension scheme, would accelerate the movement towards a pensioned society.\\n17 https://www.pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=2307\\n18 https://www.pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=2296116\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nOutlook\\n4.72 The resilience of the domestic financial system is reflected in the healthy balance sheet \\nof banks, stronger capital levels of NBFCs and robust growth in the AuM of domestic mutual \\nfunds. Buoyant demand for bank credit and early signs of a revival in the investment cycle are benefiting from improving asset quality, a return to profitability and resilient capital and liquidity buffers. Further, IBC mechanism continues to support the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in India by facilitating easy exit with time bound resolutions for firms. These strengths are helping the financial system absorb external spillovers, tightening global financial conditions and high volatility in financial markets.\\n4.73 India is one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the world and is expected to \\nemerge as one of the top six insurance markets by 2032. Digitisation of India’s insurance \\nmarket, accompanied by an increase in FDI limit for insurance companies, is likely to facilitate an increased flow of long-term capital, a global technology, processes, and international best practices, which will support the growth of India’s insurance sector. Also, as we transition to a high middle-income economy, India\\'s pension sector has tremendous scope for growth. Government initiatives towards enhancing pension literacy of subscribers and intermediaries, and a nudge from the regulator and the government to encourage young adults to join the pension scheme would play a significant role in enhancing pension availability to a more extensive section of society. CHAPTER05\\nPrices and inflation: \\nsuccessful tight-roPe Walking\\nConsumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022. A rising phase up \\nto April 2022 when it crested at 7.8 per cent, then a holding pattern at around 7.0 per cent up to August 2022 and then a decline to around 5.7 per cent by December 2022. The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country. Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank’ s tolerance limit. In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation. \\nThe divergence between a relatively high Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation and \\nlower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation widened in May 2022 primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices. However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since then, demonstrating a tendency towards convergence. An important measure of demand-pull inflation - core inflation - remains sticky. There have been significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India. \\nAccording to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the \\noverall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector. \\nRBI’ s Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity \\nadjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0 per cent to 6.25 per cent between May and December 2022. Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products. \\nThe RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing \\nto supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs. In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices. A lot depends on industrial input prices: they may ease, but 118\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n1 World Economic Outlook (WEO), IMF, October 2022on the flip side, their delayed pass-through to consumer prices may contribute to the \\nstickiness of core inflation. \\nIn general, the year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world \\nafter three to four decades, depending on the country. In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices. India’ s retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8 per cent in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world. We are confident that authorities would remain vigilant and be as proactive as they were in 2022 should inflation pressures re-emerge in India in 2023.\\nintroduction\\n5.1 Rising prices are always a cause of concern for policymakers as they hurt the common \\nman the most. The perils of inflation are felt more in developing economies, where necessities have a higher share in the consumption basket than in developed countries. In recent years, India’s inflation rate has been well-behaved, lying tamely below the RBI target rate of 4 per cent from 2017 to 2019. \\n5.2 In 2020, supply-side disruptions pushed inflation beyond the RBI’s upper tolerance limit \\nof 6 per cent. The pandemic delivered a larger shock on supply than it did on demand, through \\nsupply-chain disruptions in the case of essential goods, food, medicine and industrial goods. In turn, this aggravated cost-push inflation in the country. \\n5.3 As the pandemic receded, the conflict in Russia-Ukraine broke out, bringing in its wake \\nworldwide inflation, fuelled mostly by surging prices of crude oil and other commodities. Prices \\nsoared to a decadal high and ate into household budgets, in turn prodding Central Banks to tighten monetary policy. A convalescing world economy was left to confront unprecedented rates of inflation. The spectre of stagflation loomed large on the horizon. In response, developed economies were left with no option but to raise interest rates. As the US Federal Reserve raised rates, the US dollar appreciated, making dollar-denominated fuel imports even dearer. \\n5.4 In advanced economies, the rate of inflation is projected by the International Monetary \\nFund (IMF) to increase from 3.1 per cent in 2021 to 7.2 per cent in 2022, the highest since 1982. \\nThe Euro area saw the rate reach 10.0 per cent in September 2022 (WEO, October 2022\\n1). The \\nUS inflation reached its 40-year high at 9.1 per cent in June 2022 before moderating to 6.5 per cent in December 2022, while the UK saw an annual price rise of 9.2 per cent in December 2022. Germany witnessed inflation of 8.6 per cent in December 2022. Among emerging markets, Brazil saw a moderation in price trends, while Turkey’s inflation was above 80 per cent from August to November 2022 before declining slightly to 64.3 per cent in December 2022. The war had compounded the effects of a strong recovery in demand for goods and services after the pandemic. The inflation rate in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is anticipated to have increased from 5.9 per cent in 2021 to 9.9 per cent in 2022 (WEO, October 2022). 119\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nFigure V .1: Record Consumer Price Inflation in 2022 Calendar Year \\n1.52.7\\n2.0\\n1.41.4\\n0.30.81.72.0\\n1.4\\n0.73.17.2\\n4.45.77.1\\n5.85.5\\n4.74.74.44.55.05.15.15.99.9\\n8.1\\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nAdvanced economies EMDEs\\nSource: World Economic Outlook, October 2022, IMF\\nNote: *The figure are annual averages; figures for 2022 and 2023 are projections.

India chose not to overstimulate, and hence price pressures due to 120\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nthe Russia-Ukraine conflict could be contained. Excessive heat in summer and uneven rainfall \\nthereafter in some parts of the country affected the farm sector, reducing supply and causing prices of some major products to rise. India’s inflation rate peaked in April 2022 at 7.8 per cent before moderating to 5.7 per cent in December 2022 on the back of good monsoons as well as prompt government measures that ensured adequate food supply. Global economic slowdown and interest rate increases brought down commodity prices, contributing to a substantial decline in wholesale price inflation. Thus, input price pressures on Indian manufacturers abated. \\n5.6 Even as inflation abated at the wholesale level, there has been a pass-through of previously \\nhigh input costs onto retail prices. Core inflation remains sticky at nearly 6 per cent and reflects the \\nsecond-round effects of the supply shocks witnessed earlier this year. Further, with the recovery of demand, there has been a pickup in service inflation. Against this backdrop, we discuss trends and drivers of retail and wholesale price inflation in FY22 and FY23, state-wise and rural-urban differential in consumer inflation, fuel price inflation, CPI and WPI convergence, housing prices, pharmaceutical pricing and fiscal as well as monetary policy measures undertaken to contain inflation as the chapter proceeds.\\nDomestic Retail Inflation \\nHeadline Inflation Declined from its Peak\\n5.7 FY22 witnessed lower CPI-Combined (CPI-C) based retail inflation as compared to FY21. \\nEven so, inflation remained on the higher side when compared to the moderation seen during the years prior to the pandemic. During FY22, some sub-groups such as ‘oils & fats’, ‘fuel & light’ and ‘transport & communication’ reported high inflation. This was mainly driven by supply disruptions caused by pandemic-induced lockdowns. The subsequent year (FY23) began with the Russia-Ukraine crisis that led to high headline inflation rate in April 2022. \\n5.8 In FY23, retail inflation was mainly driven by higher food inflation, while core inflation \\nstayed at a moderate level. Food inflation ranged between 4.2 per cent to 8.6 per cent between April and December 2022, while the core inflation rate stayed at around 6 per cent except in April 2022.\\nTable V .1: Average Annual Retail Inflation Based on CPI-C (per cent) (base: 2012=100)\\nGroups/Sub-groups Weight FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*\\nFood & beverages 45.9 6.0 7.3 4.2 7.0\\nCereals and products 9.7 2.8 3.8 0.5 9.3\\nMeat and fish 3.6 9.3 15.4 7.9 4.7\\nEgg 0.4 4.5 12.9 7.6 -1.0\\nMilk and products 6.6 2.9 5.4 2.8 6.8\\nOils and fats 3.6 2.9 16.0 27.4 5.4\\nFruits 2.9 0.7 2.6 6.2 4.4\\nVegetables 6.0 21.3 5.8 -7.2 7.6\\nPulses and products 2.4 9.9 16.4 6.0 1.8121\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nWeight FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*\\n  Sugar and confectionery 1.4 0.8 2.5 2.3 2.7\\n  Spices 2.5 4.4 10.9 5.3 14.9\\n  Pan, tobacco & intoxicants 2.4 4.2 9.9 4.5 2.0\\n  Clothing & footwear 6.5 1.6 3.4 7.2 9.7\\n  housing 10.1 4.5 3.3 3.7 4.1\\n  Fuel and light 6.8 1.3 2.7 11.3 10.5\\n  Miscellaneous 28.3 4.4 6.6 6.7 6.3\\n  Household goods and services 3.8 3.1 3.0 5.8 7.5\\n  Health 5.9 6.2 5.1 7.5 5.8\\n  Transport and communication 8.6 2.4 9.9 10.1 6.4\\n  Recreation and amusement 1.7 4.9 5.1 6.5 6.4\\n  Education 4.5 5.5 2.8 2.9 5.2\\n  Headline Inflation 100.0 4.8 6.2 5.5 6.8\\n  Core Inflation 47.3 4.0 5.5 6.0 6.1\\n  Food Inflation 39.1 6.7 7.7 3.8 7.0\\nSource: MoSPI, \\nNote: *April-December, CPI data for December 2022 are provisional\\nFigure V .3: Declining Food Inflation but Sticky Core Inflation\\n012345678910\\nApr-21May-21Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22Feb-22Mar-22 Apr-22May-22Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nHeadline Inflation Food Inflation Core Inflation\\n Source: MoSPI122\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nRetail Inflation Driven by Food Commodities\\n5.9 Retail price inflation mainly stems from the agriculture and allied sector, housing, textiles, \\nand pharmaceutical sectors.

India meets 60 per cent of its edible \\noils demand through imports, making it vulnerable to international movements in prices. For instance, sunflower oil, which makes up 15 per cent of our total edible oil imports, is procured mainly from Ukraine and Russia. Thus, FY22 saw edible oil inflation on account of international price pressures. However, inflation remained subdued in FY23 because of rationalisation of tariffs and the imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds. \\nFigure V .8: Imported Inflation in Edible Oils\\n050100150200250300\\nApr-20\\nJul- 20\\nO ct -20\\nJa n-21\\nApr-21\\nJul- 21\\nO ct -21\\nJa n-22\\nApr-22\\nJul- 22\\nO ct -22Index\\nOils & fats (CPI Index), Base 2012\\nFAO Food Price Index (Oils), Base 2014-20167090110130150170190210230250270\\n130 150 170 190 210FAO food price Index (Oils) \\nOils & Fats (CPI Index) Correlation Coefficient = 0.88\\n Source: FAO and MoSPI\\nFigure V .9: Import of Edible Oils\\n020406080100120140160180\\n2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22Quantity & Value \\nQuantity (lakh tonne) Value (₹\\'000 crore)\\nSource: Solvent Extractors Association of India\\nNote: Data corresponding to oil year (November-October)126\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure V .10: Moderating Retail Prices of Edible Oils\\n100110120130140150160170180190200\\nApr-21May-21Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22May-22Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Price ( ₹/kg)\\nSoya Oil Palm Oil Sunflower Oil\\n  Source: DoCA\\nBox V .1: Measures to Contain Inflation in Essential Food Commodities\\nThe government keeps a close watch on the production and availability of essential commodities \\nthrough regular reviews by the Inter-Ministerial Committee and Committee of Secretaries.

CPI-C based food inflation seems \\nto have cooled down after reaching a high of 8.3 per cent in April 2022 due to a subsequent moderation in global food prices and a reduction in farm input costs. However, the cooling was more pronounced for urban inflation, which softened to 2.8  per cent in December 2022. Rural fuel inflation remained lower than its urban counterpart throughout the current fiscal, due to subdued price pressures on traditional fuel items such as firewood and cow dung cakes as opposed to petrol and diesel. \\n5.16 While the current fiscal year saw rural and urban inflation closely tracking each other, \\nFY22 had seen a wider differential between the two. The gap between rural and urban inflation \\nreached its widest in March 2022 due to a difference in the experience of food inflation. Urban areas experienced a sharper increase in food prices of vegetables and oils during this time as compared to the hinterlands. 128\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure V .11: Urban and Rural Inflation\\n012345678910\\nApr-21\\nJun-21\\nAug-21\\nOc t- 21\\nDec-21\\nFeb-22\\nApr-22\\nJun-22\\nAug-22\\nOc t- 22\\nDec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)Headline Inflation\\nRural Urban012345678910\\nApr-21\\nJun-21\\nAug-21\\nOc t- 21\\nDec-21\\nFeb-22\\nApr-22\\nJun-22\\nAug-22\\nOc t- 22\\nDec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)Food Inflation\\nRural Urban\\n  Source: MoSPI\\nMajority of the States/UTs have Higher Rural Inflation than Urban Inflation \\n5.17 CPI-C inflation increased in most of the states in FY23 as compared to FY22.

In rural sectors of Haryana, Mizoram, and West Bengal it was because of higher ‘food and beverages’ and ‘clothing and footwear’ inflation. In rural sectors of Madhya Pradesh, Manipur and Assam, it was due to ‘fuel and light’ segments.

As a result, the wholesale inflation rate climbed to about 13.0 per cent in FY22. Prices of items like petroleum products, basic metals, chemicals & chemical products, and edible oils, with maximum exposure to international pricing translated into a rise in the domestic WPI inflation. 130\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nTable V .2: Average Annual Wholesale Inflation Based on WPI (per cent) (Base: 2011-12=100)\\n Groups/Subgroups Weight FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23*\\nPrimary Articles 22.6 6.8 1.7 10.3 12.3\\nFood articles 15.3 8.4 3.1 4.1 8.3\\nCereals 2.8 7.5 -2.6 1.6 10.7\\nPulses 0.6 15.9 11.6 6.9 0.0\\nVegetables 1.9 31.2 3.4 0.4 13.2\\nFruits 1.6 3.2 1.4 11.3 10.4\\nNon-Food Articles 4.1 4.5 1.4 21.1 12.0\\nMinerals 0.8 13.2 6.7 19.6 6.2\\nCrude Petroleum & Natural Gas 2.4 -7.7 -17.5 56.7 57.7\\nFuel & power 13.2 -1.8 -8.0 32.6 33.8\\nLPG 0.6 -8.3 -2.7 43.3 16.9\\nPetrol 1.6 -3.2 -11.8 62.9 41.9\\nHigh Speed Diesel 3.1 -3.5 -14.4 59.9 60.8\\nManufactured Products 64.2 0.3 2.7 11.1 7.1\\nFood products 9.1 4.1 5.6 11.7 6.0\\nEdible oils 2.6 1.4 20.3 30.5 1.4\\nFood Inflation (Food articles + Food products) 24.4 6.9 3.9 6.8 7.5\\nCore Inflation (Manufactured Products-Food \\nproducts)55.1 -0.4 2.2 11.0 9.2\\nHeadline Inflation 100 1.7 1.3 13.0 11.5\\nSource: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIITNote: *April-December 2022, WPI data for November and December 2022 are provisional\\n5.20 Part of the double-digit inflation in WPI during H1 of FY23 could be attributed to food \\ninflation, which stayed at 7.5 per cent against 6.8 per cent in FY22. Cereals and vegetables \\nwere the major contributors to food inflation owing to erratic climatic conditons. Inflation in the ‘manufactured products’ subgroup in FY23 saw a considerable decline compared to the previous year due to the rationalisation of duties on critical inputs and moderation in global commodity prices. In comparison to FY22, core inflation remained lower in FY23.  \\n5.21 Overall, the monthly trend of inflation rates based on wholesale prices has been sliding \\ndownwards from its peak of 16.6 per cent in May 2022 to 10.6 per cent in September 2022 and \\nfurther to 5.0 per cent in December 2022. The decline in inflation was observed in all three subgroups of WPI.\\n5.22 As mentioned earlier, part of WPI inflation is imported inflation. The high import dependence \\non edible oils has meant that the transitory effect of rising international prices of these products \\nare also reflected in domestic prices. An RBI study\\n3 indicates that one per cent increase in prices \\nacross all the countries and sectors due to global inflation shock could increase inflation in India by around 63 basis points through second-round effects comprising domestic indirect effects (46 \\n3 Monetary Policy Report, RBI, September 2022131\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nbasis points) and global spillovers (17 basis points), in addition to the direct impact of 100 basis \\npoints. The impact of prices in world markets on WPI (manufactured products component) was clearly visible, especially in prices of oil and basic metals. In the current financial year, global prices of edible oils, rubber, cotton, crude oil, and metals decreased. Capital outflows in H1 of FY23 had impacted India’s exchange rate adversely; this was another reason for high prices of imported inputs, which are mostly dollar-denominated.\\nFigure V .14: Declining Core and Food Inflation\\n024681012141618\\nApr-21May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22Feb-22Mar-22 Apr-22May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nHeadline Inflation Food Inflation Core Inf la tion\\n Source: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\\nFigure V .15: Drivers of Wholesale Inflation in FY23* – \\'Primary Articles\\' & \\'Fuel & Power\\'\\n22.6 13.2 64.2\\n- 30 00 0. 0- 25 00 0. 0- 20 00 0. 0- 15 00 0. 0- 10 00 0. 0-5 00 0. 00 .0\\n010203040506070\\nPrimary Articles Fuel & Power Manufactured ProductsContibution (per cent)\\nFY21 FY22 FY23* Weights\\n  Source: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\\n  Note: *April-December132\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure V .16: Slackening Global Commodity Prices\\n050010001500200025003000\\nDe c-21\\nJa n-22\\nFeb- 22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun- 22\\nJul- 22\\nAug- 22\\nSep- 22\\nO ct -22\\nNov- 22\\nDe c-22Price ($/mt)\\nPalm oil ( $/mt) Soybea n oil ($/mt)\\nSunflower oil ($/mt)0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0\\nDec-21\\nJan-22\\nFeb-22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun-22\\nJul-22\\nAug-22\\nSep-22\\nOc t- 22\\nNov-22\\nDec-22Price ($/kg)\\nCotton, A Index ($/kg) Rubber,  TS R20 ($/kg)\\n8090100110120130140150160\\nDe c-21\\nJa n-22\\nFeb- 22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun- 22\\nJul- 22\\nAug- 22\\nSep- 22\\nO ct -22\\nNov- 22\\nDe c-22Price ($/dmtu*)\\nIron ore, cfr spot ($/dmtu)200030004000500060007000800090001000011000\\nDe c-21\\nJa n-22\\nFeb- 22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun- 22\\nJul- 22\\nAug- 22\\nSep- 22\\nO ct -22\\nNov- 22\\nDe c-22Price ($/mt)\\nAluminum ($/mt) Copper  ($/mt)\\n15000200002500030000350004000045000\\nDe c-21\\nJ an -22\\nFeb- 22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun- 22\\nJul- 22\\nAug- 22\\nSep- 22\\nO ct -22\\nNov- 22\\nDe c-22Price ($/mt)\\nTin ($/mt) Nickel ($/mt)1500200025003000350040004500\\nDe c-21\\nJa n-22\\nFeb- 22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun- 22\\nJul- 22\\nAug- 22\\nSep- 22\\nO ct -22\\nNov- 22\\nDe c-22Price ($/mt)\\nLe ad ($/mt) Zinc  ($/mt)\\nSource: Pink Sheet, World Bank\\nNote: *dmtu:dry metric tonne unit133\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nBox V .2: Measures to Contain Inflation in Input Prices\\n\\uf098 Fuel Prices: The Central Government has made interventions by calibrating the excise duties  \\n on petrol and diesel.

In response to subdued global demand because of Covid-19 \\ninduced restrictions, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil during FY21 stayed in the range of US$20-65/bbl. Thereafter, prices started surging on account of unprecedented cuts in crude oil supply by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing countries. The upward trend continued in FY22 and FY23, as demand picked up with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in most regions of the world. Also, owing to supply disruption amid rising tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East in June 2022, the Indian basket of crude oil peaked at US$116/bbl. Subsequently, the price declined to US$ 78/bbl in December 2022. Further, a cut in central excise duty on petrol and diesel in November 2021 and May 2022, followed by a reduction in Value Added Tax (V AT) by the State Governments, led to a moderation of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel in India.134\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure V .17: Moderation in Crude Oil Prices\\n708090100110120130\\nDec-21 Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22 May-22Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22 Nov-22 Dec-22Price (US$/bbl)\\nBrent Crude Oil Crude oil (Indian basket)\\nSource: Pink Sheet, World Bank and PPAC, MoPNG\\nConvergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\\n5.24 Inflation dynamics in India since the outbreak of the pandemic have been influenced by \\nvarious domestic and global factors. While the pass-through of international prices to wholesale \\nprices is relatively quick, it impacts retail prices with a lag. This creates a wedge between WPI and CPI inflation rates. It is also due to the difference in composition and weights assigned to different commodities in the two indices.  \\n5.25 The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as \\nWPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavourable base effects while CPI-C inflation \\nremained stable. The wedge between CPI-C and WPI inflation continued to widen before reaching its peak at 10 per cent in November 2021. Thereafter, the gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022 as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The major brunt of commodity supply chain disruption and increased demand for essentials was reflected in WPI with a short lag of 2 months. As a result, the two indicators of inflation again started diverging in May 2022. It was only after global commodity prices, including crude oil, softened and the effects of strong supporting domestic factors like favourable monsoon, vaccination-led economic resumption, etc., started to be felt that the wedge began to narrow, and it closed in November 2022, after 21 months. It also indicated the near completion of the pass-through of high input costs to the retail segment.\\n5.26 The convergence between the WPI and CPI indices was mainly driven by two factors. \\nFirstly, a cooling in inflation of commodities such as crude oil, iron, aluminium and cotton \\nled to a lower WPI. These commodities occupy a larger weight in the WPI as compared to the CPI. Further, these commodities are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices and 135\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nare used intensively by industries producing wholesale goods. As the prices cooled for these \\ncommodities, the two measures of inflation began to converge. Secondly, CPI inflation rose due to an increase in the prices of services. Services form a part of the core component of the CPI-C but are not included in the WPI basket.  \\nFigure V .18: Convergence of Headline WPI Inflation with Headline CPI-C Inflation\\n024681012141618\\nApr-21May-21Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22Feb-22Mar-22 Apr-22May-22Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nWPI CPI-C\\n Source: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\\nFigure V .19: Convergence in Core Inflation – CPI-C vs WPI\\n02468101214\\nApr-21May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22Feb-22Mar-22 Apr-22May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nWPI CPI-C\\n Source: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT136\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure V .20: Convergence in Food Inflation – CPI-C vs WPI\\n02468101214\\nApr-21May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22Feb-22Mar-22 Apr-22May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nWPI CPI-C\\n Source: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\\nFigure V .21: Convergence Between CPI (Fuel & Power) and WPI (Fuel & Light) Inflation Rates\\n0102030405060\\nApr-21May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22Feb-22Mar-22 Apr-22May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nWPI (Fuel & Power) CPI-C (Fuel & Light)\\n Source: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT137\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nFigure V .22: Convergence Between Retail and Wholesale Energy Inflation Rates\\n0102030405060708090100\\nApr-21May-21 Jun-21 Jul-21Aug-21 Sep-21 Oc t- 21Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22Feb-22Mar-22 Apr-22May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22Aug-22 Sep-22 Oc t- 22Nov-22 Dec-22Inflation Rate (per cent)\\nWPI (High Speed Diesel) WPI (Petrol) CPI-C (Transport & Communication)\\nSource: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\\nFalling Inflationary Expectations\\n5.27 Inflationary expectations are decisive in charting the course of inflation. The RBI’s \\nanchoring of inflationary expectations through forward guidance and responsive monetary \\npolicy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country. The one-year-ahead inflationary expectations by businesses have shown a decreasing trend in the current fiscal. As businesses are price-setters, their perceptions on inflation are significant in making sense of whether costs would be passed on, resulting in higher prices in the near future. Similarly, inflationary expectations by households- who are the price takers of the economy- determine their consumption choices in the near future. Much like businesses, household inflation expectations too have moderated. \\nFigure V .23: Business and Household Inflationary Expectations are Falling\\n4.04.55.05.56.06.5\\nJul-21Sep-21 Nov-21 Jan-22Mar-22 May-22Jul-22Sep-22 Nov-22Inflation Expectations (per cent)Business Inflation Expectations 1 Year Ahead\\n9.09.510.010.511.011.512.012.513.0\\nJul-21Sep-21Nov-21Jan-22Mar-22 May-22Jul-22Sep-22Nov-22Inflation Expectations (per cent)Household Inflation Expectations 1 Year Ahead\\nSource: IIM-A and RBI138\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nMonetary Policy Measures for  Price  stability\\n5.28 Reserve Bank of India\\'s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased the policy repo rate \\nunder the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 2.25 per cent (225 basis points) from 4.0 per \\ncent to 6.25 per cent between May and December 2022.\\nTable V .3: Monetary Policy Statements – Tightening Monetary Policy\\nDate of MPC Statements Changes in the Policy Repo Rate under the LAF\\n8 April 2022 Unchanged at 4 per cent\\n4 May 2022 Increased from 4.0 per cent to 4.4 per cent (40 basis points)\\n8 June 2022 Increased from 4.4 per cent to 4.9 per cent (50 basis points)\\n5 August 2022 Increased from 4.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent (50 basis points)\\n30 September 2022 Increased from 5.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent (50 basis points)\\n7 December 2022 Increased from 5.9 per cent to 6.25 per cent (35 basis points)\\n Source: RBI\\nBox V .3: How is the Current Inflation Different from the 1970s?\\nUnprecedented global inflation in the current year recalls the experience of the 1970’s, particularly \\nthe aftermath of the oil crises in 1973 and 1979. Both crises contributed to rising commodity prices worldwide and their spill-over effects on the prices of other goods and services. However, the \\nenvironment and intensity of the crises differ in various respects.\\nFirstly , recent oil price rises are proportionally smaller than the 1970s crisis, which had taken oil \\nprices to historic highs.Secondly, in contrast to the 1970s crisis, which was confined to oil prices, the recent crisis has seen pervasive price increases across a broader range of commodities. Prices of non-oil energy, some agricultural goods, fertilisers, and metals have all risen well above their pre-pandemic levels in the \\ncurrent year.\\nThirdly, commodity supply disruptions have played a smaller role in recent price increases than in the 1970s. The rise in commodity prices over the past year has been accompanied by a modest rise in the production of many commodities, although not oil. Global commodity supply chains have now become more efficient than in the 1970s and hence, the inflationary pressure can be absorbed with \\ngreater ease. However, supply disruptions could intensify over the coming year, as the war in Ukraine \\nwill lower global production of wheat, maize and fertilisers, while price caps on Russian oil and gas may reduce the supply of these products.Fourthly, global inflation, which has risen significantly since the start of 2021, follows several years of low inflation. In contrast to this, the 1973 crisis took place against a backdrop of several years of steadily rising world inflation and signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. 139\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nLastly, the 1973 crisis closely followed the collapse of the Bretton Woods managed exchange rate \\nregime as the goals and even instruments of monetary policy were poorly defined in many countries. Arguably, central banks have much clearer and more robust institutional frameworks that focus on \\nprice stability today. This has prevented inflation expectations of the public from becoming unanchored \\ndespite a sharp rise in inflation during the year 2022.\\nBesides commodity market behaviour, higher energy prices could matter less today than in the past. With \\nbetter coordination among the global central banks and the application of unconventional monetary \\npolicy tools, inflation has been controlled in a better way so that its negative spillovers are limited and \\ntransitory. The energy intensity of GDP – the amount of energy required to produce a given amount of \\ngoods and services - has fallen by around 40 per cent since the late 1970s. With the diversification of input baskets and destinations for sourcing, commodity shocks’ impact has been tamed to some extent. \\nHence, we may expect recent commodity price rises to be less disruptive than those of the 1970s.\\nSource: Annual Economic Report, June 2022 by Bank for International Settlements and V ox EU, 2022 (https://bit.ly/3XpYqsI)\\nHousing Prices: Recovering Housing Sector After the Pandemic\\n5.29 Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts \\nin asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances. Monitoring housing prices is essential \\nfor achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.  Movements in these prices affect consumption spending through its effects on household wealth and consumer confidence.\\n5.30 The National Housing Bank (NHB) publishes two Housing Price Indices (HPI), namely \\n‘HPI assessment price’ and ‘HPI market price quarterly’, with FY18 as the base year. HPI \\nassessment price is based on the valuation prices of residential units collected from primary lending institutions. In contrast, the HPI market price is based on the market prices for unsold inventories collected from developers. A composite index is calculated for 50 cities across India using the population of the cities as weights.\\n5.31 The annual variation in HPI market price ranged from an increase of 37.7 per cent in \\nBhubaneshwar to a contraction of 6.5 per cent in Indore in the Quarter Ending (QE) Sept 22 \\nover QE Sept 21.

Health \\nconcerns and stay-at-home orders led to fewer buyers looking for homes during the initial \\nphase of the pandemic in April-June, 2020. Subsequently, India’s real estate industry gained momentum from September 2020 onwards and peaked in the quarter ending in March 2021. The second wave of the pandemic affected the real estate sector yet again when home buyers delayed purchases due to mounting uncertainty and restricted movement. However, timely policy intervention by the government coupled with low home loan interest rates propped up demand and attracted buyers more readily in the affordable segment in FY23.  The overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market prices indicates a revival in the housing finance sector. A stable to moderate increase in HPI also offers confidence to homeowners and home loan financiers in terms of the retained value of the asset.\\nBox V .4: NHBs Support to the Housing Finance Sector (HFC)\\nThe last three years were challenging for the housing sector. NHB has provided a significant impetus \\nto obviate the liquidity issues faced by the Housing Finance Sector in the last 3 years.\\n\\uf098  The Liquidity Infusion Facility Scheme was launched in 2019 to support HFCs in creating \\nindividual housing loan portfolios that fall under the priority sector , as defined by the RBI. \\n\\uf098 During the COVID-19 pandemic, Special Refinance Facility (SRF) was launched for disbursing  \\n an amount of `10,000 crore provided by RBI under the Special Liquidity Facility and an amount  \\n of `5,000 crore allocated by RBI under an Additional Special Liquidity Facility. \\n\\uf098 During 2020-21, SRF 2021 was launched with a corpus of `10,000 crore provided by RBI under  \\n SLF-2.

Until 31 December 2022, ceiling prices for 890 formulations of 358 drugs/medicines across various therapeutic categories under National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), 2015 have been fixed by National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority. Subsequently, NLEM 2022 was promulgated by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in September 2022 and revised Schedule I of Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO) was notified on 11 November 2022 by Department of Pharmaceuticals incorporating NLEM, 2022. Ceiling prices of 119 formulations under NLEM, 2022 have been fixed until 31 December 2022. In addition, retail prices for 2,196 formulations have been fixed under the DPCO, 2013.\\n5.35 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched to make quality \\ngeneric medicines available at affordable prices to all. Under this scheme, dedicated outlets \\nknown as Janaushadhi Kendras are opened to provide quality generic medicines at affordable prices to all and especially to the poor and the deprived. Further, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) also provide self-employment with sustainable and regular earnings opportunities. Under the PMBJP, until 31 December 2022, more than 9000 PMBJKs have been opened across the country. At present, the product basket of PMBJP comprises 1759 medicines and 280 surgical devices available for sale.\\nConclusion\\n5.36 It is not wishful thinking that 2023 will show less macroeconomic volatility than its \\npreceding financial year. Both CPI-C and WPI have fallen below 6 per cent (which is the RBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit the economy in the first half of the current fiscal. International crude oil prices, the principal drivers of inflation this financial year, have returned to normal levels and so have prices of other major commodities. RBI projects CPI inflation for Q1 - FY24 at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 -FY24 at 5.4 per cent on the assumption of a normal monsoon.\\n5.37 India’s inflation management has been particularly noteworthy and can be contrasted with \\nadvanced economies that are still grappling with sticky inflation rates. Due to the anticipated \\nslowdown in advanced economies, inflation risks coming from global commodity prices are likely to be lower in FY24 than in FY23. However, in terms of overall risks to the benign baseline view on inflation, upside risks to India\\'s projected rates may outweigh the downside 143\\nPrices and Inflation: Successful Tight-rope Walking\\nrisks. For instance, the re-emergence of Covid-19 in China can trigger supply chain disruptions \\nas was the case during the pandemic period. On the other hand, if China returns to normalcy from Covid-19, there can be a surge in commodity demand - thus reversing the recent slump in commodity prices. Further, the probability of a soft landing in the US economy has risen in recent months, and that might keep up the US demand for oil. Similarly, the geopolitics associated with oil can particularly affect our imported inflation. \\n5.38 RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term owing to \\nsupply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike reflecting high feed costs. In general, \\nclimate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices. A lot depends on industrial input prices: they may ease, but on the flip side their delayed pass-through to consumer prices may contribute to the stickiness of core inflation. \\n5.39 Still, overall, the inflation challenge in FY24 must be a lot less stiff than it has been this \\nyear. We expect monetary and fiscal authorities to be as proactive and vigilant as they have been \\nthis year.\\n*****CHAPTER06\\nPost the massive, unexpected disruption to human lives caused by the global pandemic, \\nthe year 2022 was when humanity once again picked up the threads and took small steps \\nto get back to a semblance of normalcy. However, the challenges posed by the aftermath \\nof this crisis, subsequent waves of the pandemic and the ensuing Russia-Ukraine conflict have impacted the global as well as India’ s development trajectory. There was a stress on \\nkey aspects of social well being of citizens such as health, education and social security \\netc. and the Government stepped in to continue its support towards social infrastructure development. Standing on the brink of FY23, various indicators of social development \\nappear to have recouped. Focus on long-term goals of human development and “sabka \\nsath, sabka vikas” have assumed salience. The social sector expenditure outlay of the Centre and State Governments has increased steadily to stand at \\n₹21.3 lakh crore in FY23 \\n(BE), with its share in total General Government expenditure standing at 26.6 per cent. \\nDemonstrating the on-track progress to attain Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of \\nhalving poverty by 2030, more than 41 crore people exited poverty between 2005-06 and 2019-21 according to the UN Mutilidimensional Poverty Index. Bouquet of social \\nprotection schemes, customised for different sections of the population such as elderly, \\nunorganised workers, have been prioritised ensuring a shield of dignity for every member of society. The special focus on aspirational districts has resulted in steady improvements \\nacross health, education, financial inclusion, and basic infrastructure. Transforming \\nwelfare through technology, Aadhaar and JAM trinity have revolutionalised the universe of state-citizen interaction, enabling targeted delivery of Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) \\nthrough 318 Central schemes and over 720 State DBT schemes, seamless portability of \\nration card across States through ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ and national database of unorganised workers ‘eShram portal’. The broad-based improvement in employment \\nindicators is observed in data covering both the supply side and demand side of the  \\nlabour market. \\nLabour markets have recovered beyond pre-Covid levels, in both urban and rural \\nareas, as observed in supply-side and demand-side employment data. Quarterly urban \\nemployment data shows progress beyond pre-pandemic levels as the unemployment rate declined from 8.3 per cent in July-September 2019 to 7.2 per cent in July-September \\n2022. Reflecting rising formalisation of employment, net addition to EPFO payroll is \\nsteadily moving upward after swiftly rebounding from Covid-19, with the majority share coming from the youth. As per Annual Survey of Industries 2019-20, employment in the \\norganised manufacturing sector has maintained a steady upward trend over time, with \\nthe employment per factory also increasing gradually. Employment has been rising faster Social infraStructure \\nand employment: big tent145\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\nin factories employing more than 100 workers than in smaller ones, suggesting scaling \\nup of manufacturing units. Year-on-Year (YoY) decline in monthly demand for Mahatma \\nGandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) work is emanating \\nfrom normalisation of the rural economy due to strong agricultural growth and a swift bounce-back from Covid-19. \\nThe noticeable rise in Rural Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) from \\n19.7 per cent in 2018-19 to 27.7 per cent in 2020-21 is a positive development. Notably, India’ s female LFPR is likely to be underestimated, with reforms in survey design and \\ncontent required to capture the reality of working females more accurately. Self-Help \\nGroups (SHGs), having demonstrated their resilience and flexibility during Covid, can be an effective conduit to tap the rising willingness of females to work. The 1.2 crore SHGs, \\ncomprising of 88 per cent all women SHGs, cater to 14.2 crore households. \\nOn the human capital formation front, the twin pillars of education and health are being \\nstrengthened from the core. Within the progressive framework of the National Education \\nPolicy (NEP), the improvement in basic facilities in schools and the rising availability \\nof teachers is expected to yield dividends which will enrich the nation’ s growth and development prospects in the decades to come. The Government has also strengthened \\nthe health infrastructure and prepared itself to address present and future needs . \\nEnsuring the provision of quality health facilities to citizens, the share of government health expenditure in total health expenditure has increased from 28.6 per cent in FY14 \\nto 40.6 per cent in FY19, with a concomitant decline in out-of-pocket expenditure as \\na percentage of total health expenditure from 64.2 per cent in FY14 to 48.2 per cent in FY19. Augmenting the rural public healthcare system, the number of Sub-centres, \\nPrimary Health Centres (PHCs), and Community Health Centres (CHCs) have improved \\nsubstantially, along with a rise in doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel in the past eight years. Consequently, a host of health-related indicators such as institutional births, \\nimmunisation and, coverage of health insurance, have witnessed an uptrend, as borne \\nout by National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data. The progress of the path-breaking Ayushman Bharat programme, with nearly 22 crore beneficiaries, is being further tech-\\nenabled through digital health IDs ‘ABHA’ and telemedicine through e-Sanjeevani. \\nIn the Amrit Kaal, the lives of two-thirds of the Indian populace residing in rural India look \\nremarkably better than a few years back, aided by the policy focus on basic amenities and \\nefficient programme implementation. Outcome-oriented statistics concerning the quality \\nof rural lives establish tangible progress in access to electricity, presence of improved drinking water sources, coverage under health insurance schemes, women empowerment, \\netc. The emphasis on digital land records through SVAMITVA is structural reform in rural \\nland management and individual economic empowerment. \\nAs India marches ahead, the ground lost as regards social sector improvements due to \\nthe pandemic has largely been recouped, powered by prompt policymaking and efficient \\nimplementation interwoven with technology. Going forward with the vision of ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’, further developments will hold the key to attaining \\nmore equitable economic growth.146\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nintroduction\\n6.1\\u2003The socio-economic milieu and unique ethos of India reside in the diverse and expansive \\npopulace transcending innumerable cultures, languages, and geographies, constituting the real wealth of the country. Realising the immense potential harboured by the young and aspirational citizens spanning numerous cities and villages requires ambitious vision and meticulous implementation, customising for the diversity of circumstances and special needs of different sections. The foundational services and structures that support society in availing various amenities important for a better quality of life, i.e the social infrastructure, indirectly contributes to economic development by laying the foundation for enhancement in income and employment opportunities, productivity growth, and technological advancement. That said, quality employment opportunities and working conditions are the essential instruments to chisel this potential into long-term sustainable growth. In its Amrit Kaal for the next 25 years, India envisions rewarding itself with the dividends that can come from demographics.\\n6.2\\u2003With the overall development of the economy, the concept of quality of life has enlarged \\nto include many more elements than the traditional metrics of income (which determine the availability of basic requirements such as food and shelter) and education levels. It now encompasses access to clean drinking water, sanitation, employment prospects, health care, social security, connectivity, etc. All these together determine the quality of life. Research studies have concluded that quality of life depends upon the fulfilment of basic needs and being able to live in an affable environment.\\n1 Cognisant of this fact, the Government places a high \\npriority on the development of the social infrastructure of the country . \\n6.3\\u2003This is all the more pertinent in the contemporary scenario as India has adopted the UN SDGs 2030, which are a set of comprehensive, far-reaching, and people-centric universal and transformative goals and targets. Many of these seventeen goals concern the social well-being of individuals, resolving as follows:\\n“We resolve, between now and 2030, to end poverty and hunger everywhere; to combat inequalities \\nwithin and among countries; to build peaceful, just, and inclusive societies; to protect human rights and promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and to ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources. We resolve also to create conditions for sustainable, inclusive and sustained economic growth, shared prosperity and decent work for all, taking into account different levels of national development and capacities.”\\n2\\n6.4\\u2003The country continues to make good progress in increasing incomes and improving the standard of living over the past decades. As detailed in the chapter, many social indicators have continued to improve. The years 2020 and 2021 were the peak years of the pandemic, which tested the strength of the country’s social and health infrastructure, hampering education, loss of job opportunities, etc. Several measures were taken to meet the growing needs of the health pandemic during this time, extending into 2022. FY23 has been a year of rejuvenation for the sector, having withered the storm of the pandemic and come out stronger. Various dimensions of the sector are recouping lost grounds and are on the path of reenergising to meet the vision of “sabka sath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas”.\\n1\\u2002For example: Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen, ed.

This Chapter presents emerging evidence of the achievements on these fronts. It reviews the progress on the social infrastructure front and the enhancement of employment opportunities in the country. It covers various aspects of the social sector, including trends in the Government’s expenditure on the social sector; the progress on the human development front; multiple measures being taken to ensure basic necessities to all citizens; the trends in employment and education and measures to enhance the quality of life and governance in rural areas. It dwells on various Government initiatives towards attaining different SDGs and the outcomes thereof.\\nSocial Sector expenditure Keeping pace with growing importance of the Sector\\n6.6\\u2003The Government’s spending on social services3 has shown a rising trend since FY16 \\nwith a focus on many aspects of the social well-being of citizens of the country. The share of expenditure on social services in the total expenditure of the Government has been around 25 per cent from FY18 to FY20. It increased to 26.6 per cent in FY23 (BE). The social services expenditure witnessed an increase of 8.4 per cent in FY21 over FY20 and another 31.4 per cent increase in FY22 over FY21, being the pandemic years, which required enhanced outlay, especially in the health\\n4 and education5 sectors.

The National Health Policy, 2017 envisages as its goal “the attainment of the highest possible level of health and well-being for all at all ages, through a preventive and promotive healthcare orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality healthcare services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence. This would be achieved through increasing access, improving quality, and lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.” Accordingly, the policy recommended an increase in the Government’s health expenditure from the existing 1.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025. Also, the Fifteenth Finance Commission, in its report, had recommended that public health expenditure of Union and States together should be increased in a progressive manner to reach 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025 (FFC report, para 9.41, iii) . In \\nkeeping with this objective, Central and State Governments’ budgeted expenditure on the health sector reached 2.1 per cent of GDP in FY23 (BE) and 2.2 per cent in FY22 (RE), against 1.6 per cent in FY21.\\ntable Vi.1: trends in social services expenditure by general government  \\n(combined centre and States)\\n(` crore)\\nitems 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 re 2022-23 be\\ntotal expenditure 3760611 4265969 4515946 5040747 5410887 6353359 7453320 8008684\\nexpenditure on Social \\nServices915500 1040620 1139524 1278124 1364906 1479389 1944013 2132059\\nof which:\\n Education 391881 434974 483481 526481 579575 575834 681396 757138\\nHealth 175272 213119 243388 265813 272648 317687 516427 548855\\nOthers 348348 392527 412655 485829 512683 585868 746191 826065\\nas per cent of gdp\\nexpenditure on Social \\nServices6.6 6.8 6.7 6.8 6.8 7.5 8.2 8.3\\nof which:\\nEducation 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.9 2.9 2.9 2.9\\n Health 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.6 2.2 2.1\\nOthers 2.5 2.6 2.4 2.6 2.6 3.0 3.2 3.2\\nas per cent of total expenditure\\nexpenditure on Social \\nServices24.3 24.4 25.2 25.4 25.2 23.3 26.1 26.6\\nof which: \\nEducation 10.4 10.2 10.7 10.4 10.7 9.1 9.1 9.5\\nHealth 4.7 5.0 5.4 5.3 5.0 5.0 6.9 6.9\\nOthers 9.3 9.2 9.1 9.6 9.5 9.2 10.0 10.3\\nas per cent of social services\\n education 42.8 41.8 42.4 41.2 42.5 38.9 35.1 35.5\\nHealth 19.1 20.5 21.4 20.8 20.0 21.5 26.6 25.7\\nothers 38.0 37.7 36.2 38.0 37.6 39.6 38.4 38.7\\nThe ratios to GDP at current market prices are based on 2011-12 base till 2021-22. \\nGDP for 2022-23 is as per Union Budget 2022-23.\\nSources: Budget Documents of Union and State Governments.149\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\nimproving Human development parameters\\n6.8\\u2003‘Human Development’ is the key enabler for upward social mobility. The challenges \\nposed by the aftermath of the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and the ensuing Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 have impacted the development trajectory of India and the world. In the wake of these developments, there was a global decline in human development. According to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, 90 per cent of countries have registered a reduction in their Human Development Index (HDI)\\n6 value in 2020 or 2021, \\nindicating that human development across the world has stalled for the first time in 32 years.

It reveals \\nwho is poor and how they are poor and the range of different deprivations experienced by them.\\nOne such measure is the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) global Multidimensional \\nPoverty Index (MPI) which measures acute multidimensional poverty across more than 100 \\ndeveloping countries. The methodology involves measuring each person’s overlapping deprivations \\nacross 10 indicators in three equally weighted dimensions: health, education, and standard of living. The health and education dimensions are based on two indicators each, while the standard of living \\nis based on six indicators. All the indicators needed to construct the MPI for a country are taken from \\nthe same household survey. Each indicator is equally weighted within its dimension, so the health and education indicators are weighted 1/6 each, and the standard of living indicators are weighted 1/18 \\neach. The MPI ranges from 0 to 1, and higher values imply higher multidimensional poverty. The MPI \\ncomplements the international US$ 1.90-a-day poverty line by identifying who is multidimensionally poor and shows the composition of multidimensional poverty.\\nmpi for india \\nThe 2022 report of the UNDP on MPI was released in October 2022 and covers 111 developing \\ncountries.

For instance, in 10 indicators of health, 73 ADs have surpassed the state averages.\\n(b)  The programme monitors progress across five focus sectors. All districts have made significant improvements across different indicators for instance, under Health and Nutrition, 46 districts have improved by up to 45 per cent, and 23 districts have improved by up to 69 per cent in critical indicators related to pregnant women’s health which have a bearing on the Maternal and Infant Mortality Rates such as frequency and coverage of antenatal care check-ups; regularity of supplementary nutrition intake by pregnant women, and timely Anaemia detection and treatment rate. Under education, 46 districts have improved by up to 34 per cent, and 29 districts have improved by up to 49 per cent in critical indicators which affect learning outcomes attained by students such as the percentage of elementary schools complying with Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE) specified Pupil-Teacher Ratio; percentage of schools with functional drinking water facility and percentage of schools with functional girls’ toilets.\\n(c)  While monitoring the outcome of financial inclusion, it was seen that ADs have performed better than non-aspirational districts. This means more people have access to bank accounts, more have been covered under the fold of government insurance schemes and more can secure MUDRA loans in ADs. \\n(d)  Several ADs have reported saturation in the basic infrastructure indicators like the percentage of households with electricity connection; percentage of habitations with 153\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\naccess to all-weather roads under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY); \\ncumulative number of kilometres of all-weather road work completed as a percentage of total sanctioned kilometres in the district under PMGSY; and percentage of households with individual household washrooms, etc.\\nTemplate of Good Governance \\n6.15\\u2003The ADP has emerged as a template for good governance, especially in remote and difficult areas. At present, two programmes have been conceptualised along the lines of ADP design, one is ‘Mission Utkarsh’ and the other is ‘Aspirational Blocks Programme’ (ABP). On \\n22 January 2022, ‘Mission Utkarsh’ was launched, under which 15 Central Ministries, having an interface with the public, have identified their low performing 10-15 districts. Following the ADP template, the Ministries have launched actions to bring these districts at par with an average district in the state in one year and close to the all-India average in another . \\n6.16\\u2003The Central Government and States have come together to use the ADP template to identify backward blocks and use similar data monitoring and competition-based programme to improve the most under-developed blocks in the country. In order to further strengthen this initiative, 500 most backward blocks across States and UTs have been identified for rapid development.\\nprogressing labour reform measures\\n6.17\\u2003In 2019 and 2020, 29 Central Labour Laws were amalgamated, rationalised, and simplified into four Labour Codes, viz., the Code on Wages, 2019 (August 2019), the Industrial \\nRelations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020, and the Occupational Safety, Health & Working Conditions Code, 2020 (September 2020). The new laws are in tune with the changing labour market trends and, at the same time, accommodate the minimum wage requirement and welfare needs of the unorganised sector workers, including the self-employed and migrant workers, within the legislation framework. The Labour Codes have been aligned with the present economic scenario and technological advancements along with reduction in multiplicity of definitions and authorities. The Codes also ease compliance mechanism aiming to promote ease of doing business/setting up of enterprises and catalyse creation of employment opportunities while ensuring safety, health and social security of every worker. Use of technology, such as, web-based Inspection has been introduced in order to ensure transparency and accountability in enforcement. Decriminalisation of minor offences has also been provided in the Labour Codes.\\n6.18\\u2003Rules made under the Codes have been entrusted to Central Government, State \\nGovernment and at appropriate level. There is a requirement for pre-publication of Rules in their official Gazettes for public consultation. As of 13 December 2022, 31 States also have pre-published the draft rules under the Code on Wages, 28 States under Industrial Relations Code, 28 States under Code on Social Security, and 26 States under Occupational Safety Health and Working Conditions Code. 154\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\ntable Vi.3: Status of rules by States/ut s under the four labour codes\\nname of code name of States which have pre-published the draft rules\\nThe Code on \\nWages, 2019Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, \\nMaharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, UTs of Andaman & \\nNicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, NCT of Delhi and \\nPuducherry (31)\\nThe Industrial Relations Code, \\n2020Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, \\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, \\nMaharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, \\nTripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry ( 28)\\nThe Code on \\nSocial Security, \\n2020Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, \\nGujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya \\nPradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, UTs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, \\nChandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry (28)\\nThe \\nOccupational \\nSafety Health \\nand working Conditions \\nCode, 2020Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, \\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, \\nMaharashtra, Manipur, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, \\nUttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry (26)\\nSource: Ministry of Labour & Employment; status as of 13 December 2022\\ne-Shram portal\\n6.19\\u2003The Government has been working on improving life and dignity of labour force of \\ncountry by protecting and safeguarding the interest of workers, promoting their welfare and providing social security both in organised and unorganised sectors.

It connects the Government and the individual, replacing the disentangled web of multiple IDs for multiple purposes, and secures the social contract between the State and the Citizen. It is because of the initiative taken in 2010 that today, the nation is consistently building and strengthening a digital economy which will ultimately give a global competitive advantage in how money and goods move around the country over its competitors. \\n6.22\\u2003Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate and former World Bank Chief Economist, has described \\nwhat 135 crore citizens of India, which is 94 per cent of the population and 100 per cent of the adult (>18 years), have as “the most sophisticated ID programme in the world.”\\n11 Aadhaar \\nprovides a conclusive connection between the photograph of the Aadhaar holder, his/her fingerprints, and iris scan details.\\nachievements of aadhaar\\n6.23\\u2003Aadhaar is an essential tool for social delivery by the State. 318 Central schemes and over 720 state DBT schemes are notified under section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and all these schemes use Aadhaar for targeted delivery of financial services, subsidies, and benefits. Aadhaar is the foundation of India’s digital integration, as shown by the following statistics (as of November 2022):\\n• Aadhaar Generated- 135.2 crore \\n11\\u2002“\\'Adhaar\\' most sophisticated ID programme in the world: World Bank”.

The number is sufficient to transfer any payment to an individual’s bank account through Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB), thus eliminating the need to give other details, viz. the bank account, IFSC Code, and bank branch details to the Government/Institutions. \\n• Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS): AEPS helps an individual to do basic banking transactions, viz. withdrawal, cash deposit, transfer of funds from his bank account, etc., by simply using his Aadhaar. This has immensely facilitated providing door-step banking services and helped mitigate the hardships of the people due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \\n• JAM (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) trinity, combined with the power of DBT, has brought the marginalised sections of society into the formal financial system, revolutionising the path of transparent and accountable governance by empowering the people. Till November 2022, multiple large central schemes, including PAHAL, MGNREGS, etc., have paid over \\n`7,66,055.9 crore through over 1,010 crore successful transactions.12\\n• One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) Scheme: Aadhaar has played a key role in the \\nimplementation of the ONORC Scheme. While Aadhaar seeding of the PDS database has resulted in significant savings due to eliminating ghost and duplicate beneficiaries. Grain disbursal through Aadhaar-based Biometric Authentication has brought meaningful transparency and back-office improvement of the logistic network of PDS. Free distribution of food grains under ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana’ (PMGKY) has greatly mitigated the Covid pandemic’s impact, especially for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society.\\n• PM Kisan Samman Nidhi: Aadhaar platform forms the backbone for the implementation of this scheme, right from registration through Aadhaar eKYC to DBT through the APB. \\n• Co-WIN: Successful management of the Covid pandemic without the Co-WIN platform \\nwould not have been possible.

It also has the responsibility to take necessary measures to ensure that the information stored in the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) is secured and protected against unauthorised access or misuse. The ecosystem required for the purpose now consists of the following (as of 30 November 2022):\\n• 66,103 Aadhaar counters and 34,834 Child Enrolment Lite Client devices are functional\\n• 180 Active Registrars\\n• 507 Active Enrolment Agencies\\n• UIDAI run 88 Aadhaar Sewa Kendra are functional in 72 cities\\n• 15,002 Village Level Entrepreneurs operational as Banking Correspondents permitted to \\nundertake Aadhaar updates services\\n• Around 53,750 postmen/Grameen Dak Sewaks under India Post Payment Bank have been approved to provide mobile number update facility\\n• 178Aadhaar User Agencies\\n• 169 e-KYC user agencies\\nimproving employment t rends\\n6.26\\u2003Employment trends can be studied from the supply side of labour through household surveys such as the PLFS conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), and the demand side of labour through enterprise or establishment surveys such as the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) by MoSPI, Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) by Labour Bureau, etc. These enable a complete view of the labour market and the trends therein.\\n6.27\\u2003The broad-based improvement in employment indicators can be observed in data covering \\nboth the supply side and demand side of the labour market. Labour markets have recovered beyond pre-Covid levels, in both urban and rural areas, with unemployment rates falling from 5.8 per cent in 2018-19 to 4.2 per cent in 2020-21, and a noticeable rise in rural FLFPR from 19.7 per cent in 2018-19 to 27.7 per cent in 2020-21. More recent urban employment data shows progress beyond pre-pandemic levels as the unemployment rate declined from 8.3 per cent in July-September 2019 to 7.2 per cent in July-September 2022.\\nThe net addition to EPFO payroll is steadily moving upward, with the majority share coming \\nfrom the youth. Employment in nine major sectors has increased by 10 lakh over the year 2021-22 as per the QES. Employment in the organised manufacturing sector has also been rising over the years, as per the ASI 2019-20 data.

Measurement of employment through the survey \\ndesign and content can make a significant difference to final LFPR estimates, and this matters more \\nfor measuring female LFPR than male LFPR. Here, three main measurement issues have been highlighted: overly broad categories, reliance on a single question to categorize labour force status, \\nand the narrow approach of limiting productive work to labour force participation.\\nuse of overly broad categories clubbing productive work (collection of firewood, poultry \\nfarming, etc.) with domestic duties can in one sweep shift a significant proportion of women in the \\nlabour force into the out-of- labour-force category. For example, unless the production of primary \\ngoods is identified as the main activity by the respondent, the PLFS questionnaire would categorize \\nwomen who do both domestic activities and primary goods production/collection into ‘Activity Code \\n93,\\n19 and thus out-of-the-labour-force.\\n19\\u2002In the NSSO survey questionnaires, activity status codes are assigned to each household member, according to their primary activity under -\\ntaken. Activity code 93 refers to “engaged in domestic duties and also engaged in free collection of goods (vegetable, firewood, cattle feed, \\netc.), tailoring, etc. for household use”. 161\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\n\\u2003\\nAdding the proportion of women in Activity code 93 to the official LFPR yields an “Augmented \\nFemale LFPR” of 46.2 per cent for FY21 for ages 15 years and above, much higher than the 32.5 \\nper cent estimated by the conventional definition (PLFS data for usual status). A similar attempt has \\nbeen made in an International Labour Organization (ILO) research paper20, arriving at a female LFPR \\nof 56.4 per cent in India for 2012, against the far lower official estimate of 31.2 per cent for 2012.\\n 32.546.2\\n010203040506070\\n1999-00 2004-05 2009-10 2011-12 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21per centFemale LFPR: Rural + Urban\\nOfficial Augmented\\nSource: NSS Employment Unemployment Survey (NSS-EUS) for 1999-00 to 2011-12, PLFS from \\n2017-18 to 2011-12.Augmented FLPR calculations estimated using NSO dataNote: 1.

NSS-EUS and PLFS may not be comparable, given different sampling weights, frequencies, and data collection techniques.\\nno recovery questions in the plfS questionnaire: The survey design relies mainly on a single \\nquestion for measuring the labour force status of an individual, which eliminates the scope to rectify \\nany error in self-reporting, considering the large rural population and literacy levels. Contrary to ILO \\nrecommendations, there are no additional questions (‘recovery questions’) in the PLFS questionnaire to double-check individuals’ labour force status, relying too much on how the individual self-identifies \\nin the first instance. ILO recommends using multiple probing or recovery questions such as “whether \\nthe person helped in the family business” and “whether the person worked in own business in last one \\nweek/year” and “whether person helped the family with job”.\\nIn a World Bank and ILO study in Sri Lanka\\n21, such methodological issues accounted for close to \\neight percentage point underestimation of the female employment-to-population ratio.\\nmeasurement of “Work” alongside “employment”: There is a need to broaden the horizon of \\nmeasuring work, which constitutes the whole universe of productive activities alongside employment.

The definition of work is aligned with the General production boundary as defined in the System of National Accounts 2008, including own use production work and volunteer work.162\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nnarrow and only measures work as a market product. It does not include the value of women’s \\nunpaid domestic work, which can be seen as expenditure-saving work such as collecting firewood, \\ncooking, tutoring children, etc, and contributes significantly to the household’s standard of living. \\nThus, a wholesome measurement of “work” may require improved quantification through redesigned surveys.\\nThat said, there is further significant scope to nullify the gender-based disadvantages to enable \\nfree choice of women to join the labour market. Ecosystem services, including affordable creches, career counselling/handholding, lodging and transportation, etc., can further help unlock the gender \\ndividend for inclusive and broad-based growth.\\n6.32\\u2003It may be noted that more than 75 per cent of rural female workers are employed in \\nthe agricultural sector. This implies a need to upskill and create employment for women in agriculture-related sectors such as food processing. Here, the self-help groups (SHGs) can play a crucial role in shaping rural women’s potential into concrete developmental outcomes of financial inclusion, livelihood diversification, and skill development as discussed in Box VI.3.\\nbox Vi.3: role of Self-Help groups in Women’s empowerment\\nThe Self-Help Groups (SHGs)23 movement, based on the principles of group solidarity and \\nmicrofinance, has existed in India for 50 years in one form or another, with its roots tracing back to \\nthe formation of the Self-Employed Women’s Association in 1972. The transformative potential of \\nSHGs, exemplified through their key role in the on-ground response to Covid-19, has served as the fulcrum of rural development through women empowerment.\\nIndia has around 1.2 crore SHGs, 88 per cent being all-women SHGs. Success stories include \\nKudumbashree in Kerala, Jeevika in Bihar, Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahila Mandal in Maharashtra, and recently, Looms of Ladakh.\\nThe SHG Bank Linkage Project (SHG-BLP), launched in 1992, has blossomed into the world’s \\nlargest microfinance project. The SHG movement, now in its 30th year, has emerged as a powerful intervention to cover the small and marginalised sections. Currently, bank-linked SHGs are promoted \\nthrough Central Government, State Governments, NGOs, etc. They must practice the ‘Panchasutra’ \\nof regular meetings, regular savings, regular inter-loaning, timely repayment and up-to-date books of \\naccounts to avail of loans from banks. With the active collaboration of stakeholders, the SHG-BLP \\ncovers 14.2 crore families through 119 lakh SHGs with savings deposits of `47,240.5 crore and 67 \\nlakh groups with collateral-free loans outstanding of `1,51,051.3 crore, as on 31 March 2022. The \\nnumber of SHGs credit linked has grown at a CAGR of 10.8 per cent during the last ten years (FY13 to FY22), while credit disbursement per SHG has grown at a CAGR of 5.7 per cent during the same period. Notably, SHGs’ bank repayment is more than 96 per cent, underscoring their credit discipline \\nand reliability.\\n23\\u2002A SHG is a socially and economically homogenous group of up to 20 persons, formed voluntarily for the collective purpose of savings and \\ncredit, with no insistence on collateral for loans and end usage of credit. 163\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\ntable: progress under SHg-bank linkage programme\\n(2019-20 to 2021-22)\\n(Number in lakh/Amount in ` crore)\\nparticulars2019-20 2020-21 2021-22\\nno. of SHgs amount no. of SHgs amount no. of SHgs amount\\nSHG \\nSavings with Banks as of 31st MarchTotal SHG Nos. 102.4 \\n(2.3) 26152.1 \\n(12.1) 112.2  \\n(9.6)37477.6 \\n (43.3)118.9  \\n(5.9)47240.5 \\n(26.1)\\nAll women SHGs (W)88.3 \\n (3.5) 23320.6 \\n(13.9) 97.3  \\n(10.1)32686.1 \\n(40.2)104.1 \\n(7.0)42104.8 \\n(28.8)\\n% of W 86.2 89.2 86.7 87.2 87.5 89.1\\nDAY-NRLM SHGs57.9  \\n(3.8) 14312.7 \\n(11.2) 64.8  \\n(11.9)19353.7 \\n(35.2)71.8  \\n(10.9)27576.9 \\n(42.5)\\nLoans Disbursed to SHGs during the yearTotal No. of SHGs extended loans. 31.5 \\n (16.6) 77659.4 \\n(33.2) 28.9  \\n(-8.2)58070.7 \\n (-25.2)33.9 \\n(17.7)99729.2 \\n(71.7)\\nAll women SHGs (W)28.8  \\n(21.9) 73297.6 \\n(37.6) 25.9  \\n(-10.2)54423.1  \\n(-25.8)31.5 \\n(21.6)93817.2 \\n(72.4)\\n% of W 91.7 94.4 89.7 93.7 92.7 94.1\\nDAY-NRLM SHGs20.5  \\n(24.3) 52183.7 \\n(56.2) 15.8  \\n(-22.7)29643.0 \\n (-43.2)22.9 \\n(44.6)63100.8 \\n(112.9)\\n(Figures in parenthesis indicate the increase/decrease over the previous year)\\nSource: NABARD\\nimpact of SHgs: empowered Women, empowered Hinterland\\nWomen’s economic SHGs have a positive, statistically significant effect on women’s economic, \\nsocial, and political empowerment, with positive effects on empowerment achieved through various \\npathways such as familiarity with handling money, financial decision-making, improved social networks\\n24, asset ownership25 and livelihood diversification26.\\nAccording to an recent assessment27 of DAY-National Rural Livelihood Mission, which is being \\nundertaken through the SHGs, (for details see para 6.104) both participants and functionaries perceived \\nhigh impacts of the programme in areas related to women empowerment, self-esteem enhancement, \\npersonality development, reduced social evils; and additionally, medium impacts in terms of better education, higher participation in village institutions and better access to government schemes.\\ncovid-19 response as a montage of SHg’s potential \\nGovernment’s Covid-19 Package for SHGs• Under PMGKY , the limit for collateral-free loans for women’s SHGs was doubled from `10 lakh \\nto `20 lakh.

They emerged as pivotal players in crisis management, leading from the front in - producing masks (with cultural variants \\nsuch as Gamusa Masks in Assam), sanitisers, and protective gear, creating awareness about the \\npandemic (e.g. Patrakar Didis of Jharkhand), delivering essential goods (e.g. Floating supermarkets \\nin Kerala), running community kitchens (e.g. Prerna Canteens in Uttar Pradesh), supporting farm \\nlivelihoods (e.g. Pashu Sakhis for animal health care services, Aajeevika Farm Fresh Online selling and distribution mechanism for vegetables in Jharkhand), convergence with MGNREGS (in UP, \\nBihar, Chhattisgarh), and in delivery of financial services (e.g. Bank Sakhis managing bank rush for \\navailing Covid-relief DBT cash transfers). The production of masks by SHGs has been a noteworthy contribution, enabling access to and use of masks by communities in remote rural areas and providing \\nvital protection against the Covid-19 virus. As on 4 January 2023, more than 16.9 crore masks were \\nproduced by SHGs under DAY-NRLM.\\nWay forward\\nSHGs are well-placed to facilitate overall rural development owing to their access to the last mile, \\nability to draw on communities’ trust and solidarity, knowledge of local dynamics, and ability to \\nswiftly manufacture simple products and services through the aggregation of members’ economic \\nactivities. The demonstration of their resilience and flexibility during crises, including Covid, needs \\nto be thus regularised for long-run rural transformation. This includes, among other things, addressing inter-regional disparity in the deepening of the SHG movement, graduating SHG members into \\nmicro-entrepreneurs, culturally contextualised skill development for moving up the value chain in \\nproducts and services, and including the least privileged under the SHG umbrella . \\nQuarterly plfS for urban areas \\n6.33 The PLFS conducted by the MoSPI at a quarterly level for urban areas is available till \\nJuly-September 2022.

The increase in estimates of workers from Q1FY22 to Q4FY22 was driven by rising employment in sectors such as IT/BPO (by 17.6 lakh), health (7.8 lakh), and education (1.7 lakh), due to rising digitisation and resurgence of services sector economy.\\n6.37\\u2003Regarding terms of employment, regular employees constituted the majority of workers \\nacross sectors, with a share of 86.4 per cent in the total workforce in Q4FY22.

For example, out of an estimated 1,98,628 factories in operation, 1,34,577 factories are found to employ less than 50 employees each. However, the distribution of persons engaged is more balanced and right-skewed, with larger factories accounting for a greater share of employment. For instance, 77.3 per cent of the total persons engaged are in factories engaging more than 100 persons. Over time, there is a visible trend towards bigger factories employing more than 100 workers, their numbers rising by 12.7 per cent from FY17 to FY20, compared to a broadly constant number of smaller factories. Between FY17 and FY20, total persons engaged in larger factories rose by 13.7 per cent, compared to 4.6 per cent in smaller factories. Resultantly, the share of larger factories in the total number of factories has increased from 18 per cent in FY17 to 19.8 per cent in FY20, and their share in total persons engaged shows a similar expansion from 75.8 per cent in FY17 to 77.3 per cent in FY20. Thus, in terms of total persons engaged, employment has been rising in larger factories (employing more than 100 workers) than in smaller ones, suggesting scaling up of manufacturing units.  \\nfigure Vi.9: trends in employment in factories as per aSi\\n 010203040\\n0 - 14\\n15 - 19\\n20 - 29\\n30 - 49\\n50 - 99\\n100 - 199\\n200 - 499\\n500 - 999\\n1000 - 1999\\n2000 - 4999\\n5000 &\\naboveper cent\\nEmployment RangeDistribution of Factories and Persons Engaged by Employment Range\\nFactories in Operation Total Persons Engaged169\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\n 020406080100120\\nFactory size less than\\n100Factory size more than\\n100numbers in lakhWorkers by Employment Size of \\nFactories\\n2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20\\n 020406080100120140\\nFactory size less than 100 Factory size more than\\n100numbers in lakhTotal Persons Engaged by Employment \\nSize of Factories\\n2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20\\nSource: ASI, MoSPI\\nformal employment \\n6.41\\u2003Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the \\nGovernment.

So \\nfar, more than 400 plus Recruting Agents have registered on the NCS portal and posted around 1400 \\nplus international vacancies.\\nthe trend in rural wages \\n6.48\\u2003Nominal rural wages have increased at a steady positive rate during FY23 (till November \\n2022). In agriculture, the YoY rate of growth of nominal wage rates in agriculture was 5.1 per cent for men and 7.5 per cent for women, during the period April-November 2022. In non-174\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nagricultural activities, the growth of nominal wage rates was 4.7 per cent for men and 3.7 per \\ncent for women, during the same period. However, growth in real rural wages has been negative due to elevated inflation. Going forward, as inflation is expected to soften with the easing of international commodity prices and domestic food prices, it is expected that this will translate into a rise in real wages.\\nfigure Vi.14: trends in rural wages\\nNominal Rural Wage: Agriculture  Nominal Rural Wage: Non-Agriculture \\n 200225250275300325350375\\nMay-20\\nJul-20\\nSep-20\\nNov-20\\nJan-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul-21\\nSep-21\\nNov-21\\nJan-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul-22\\nSep-22\\nNov-22Men Women\\n 200225250275300325350375400425\\nMay-20\\nJul-20\\nSep-20\\nNov-20\\nJan-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul-21\\nSep-21\\nNov-21\\nJan-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul-22\\nSep-22\\nNov-22Men Women\\nReal Rural Wage: Agriculture Real Rural Wage: Non-Agriculture\\n 125150175200225250\\nMay-20\\nJul-20\\nSep-20\\nNov-20\\nJan-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul-21\\nSep-21\\nNov-21\\nJan-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul-22\\nSep-22\\nNov-22Men Women\\n 125150175200225250275\\nMay-20\\nJul-20\\nSep-20\\nNov-20\\nJan-21\\nMar-21\\nMay-21\\nJul-21\\nSep-21\\nNov-21\\nJan-22\\nMar-22\\nMay-22\\nJul-22\\nSep-22\\nNov-22Men Women\\nSource: Monthly Rural Wage Rates by Labour Bureau33\\nensuring Quality education for all\\n6.49\\u2003The importance of education for all cannot be overemphasised as it is the foundation of \\nevery individual and society’s development.

This goal is of critical importance because of the transformative effects that it can have on most other SDGs, such as “no poverty”, “zero hunger”, “gender equality” etc. Sustainable development, in fact, hinges on every child receiving quality education, offering them the tools to develop to their full potential and become productive citizens aiding their own socioeconomic progress and that of their nation. \\n6.51\\u2003It is in this context that the NEP 2020 was laid down as the first education policy of the \\n21\\nst century, aiming to address the many growing developmental imperatives of the country. \\nRecognising that education is the lifeblood of human capital formation for a young country like India, this policy provided for the revision and revamping of all aspects of the education structure. This includes its regulation and governance, creation of a new system that is aligned with the aspirational goals of 21\\nst century-education, including SDG4, while building upon \\nIndia’s traditions and value systems.

This not only ensures quality services at the grassroot level but also reduces the chances of ailments requiring secondary or tertiary healthcare services. Between FY14 and FY19, the share of primary and secondary care in the GHE increased from 74.4 per cent to 85.7 per cent.

The programme was expanded to include all persons aged 12 years and above and for the precautionary dose for all persons aged 18 years and above. Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour continue to remain the tested strategy for Covid management.\\n6.92\\u2003The introduction of Covid-19 vaccines entailed many challenges such as research and \\ndevelopment for new Covid vaccines, training of more than 2.6 lakh vaccinators and 4.8 lakh other vaccination team members, optimum utilisation of available vaccine, difficult-to-reach population, and the need to ensure all essential health services along with scaling up of vaccination programme. In addition, logistical challenges such as storage and decentralised distribution of vaccines across 29,000 cold chain points, augmenting cold chain capacity, and developing IT platform for registering the beneficiaries and vaccine service delivery, were also noticed.

These included ramping up health \\ninfrastructure, both physical and digital, enhanced training of health professionals and, continuing with the mass vaccination drive. \\nUnder the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, the Union Government focussed on scaling up expenditure \\non health infrastructure by (a) investing in grass root health institutions and ramping up HWCs in rural and urban areas; (b) setting up critical care hospital blocks in all districts; and (c) strengthening the \\nlaboratory network and surveillance by integrated public health laboratories in all districts and blocks \\nand public health units to manage pandemics. The State Governments also took various measures \\nto fight the pandemic. This was complemented by digital infrastructure through Co-WIN for mass \\nvaccination and e-Sanjeevani for telemedicine to reach the last mile. The timely intervention at all levels helped India navigate the Covid pandemic successfully despite successive shocks.\\nIn the last few months, the caseload has subsided significantly, where the active caseload is below \\n4000 and daily new cases recorded below 300 ( as of 29 December 2022).

No set of measures is sufficient to counter any instantaneous \\nshock like the Covid pandemic, as the measures are designed with the assumption of ‘ceteris paribus’, meaning everything else remains the same. But the major difference is that we are operating in a new \\nnormal, and hence towards the end, it is all about better management of the crisis and planning ahead. \\nThus, the strong inventory India has built over the last few years will improve the country’s overall \\nhealth infrastructure and governance system.198\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nbox Vi.10: co-Win: a successful digital story of vaccination to tell\\nThe history of vaccines and vaccinations in India takes us back to 1802 when the first dose of vaccine \\nwas registered for smallpox.48 Tracing the medical history of the vaccines during those times was a \\nrigorous task. However, in the contemporary scenario, we have substantially progressed in the digital \\njourney, and most medical science searches are a ‘click’ away. Also, even before Covid arrived, India \\nhad laid down the strategy for mass vaccination as year-long programs were running for several other diseases. Over the years, the government focused on digital health service delivery by imbibing the \\nbasic philosophy of “Antyodaya”. However, the need for end-to-end digitisation in the vaccination \\nprocess was felt as this was the only way to achieve herd immunity during the pandemic. While many \\neconomies had to develop a model from scratch, India was in a comfortable position. Thanks to the \\nGovernment’s vision of the JAM trinity, the critical challenge was addressed in a time-bound manner through Co-WIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) in implementing the National Covid-19 \\nVaccination Programme. \\nCo-WIN has been developed as an extension of the eVIN (electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network) \\nplatform. A comprehensive cloud-based IT solution for planning, implementing, monitoring, and \\nevaluating Covid-19 vaccination in India, the Co-WIN system provided an end-to-end solution \\nwith utilities for the entire public health system. The dual interface of the open platform made it scalable across citizen and administrator-centric services. To ensure accountability and transparency \\nin supply chains for vaccination, the platform provided real-time stock tracking at the national, state, \\nand district levels (Government and Private). This further plugged the wastage of Covid-19 vaccines, which otherwise occurred pre-Co-WIN.\\nGoing beyond the users (admins, supervisors, and vaccinators), vaccination centres, and beneficiaries’ \\nregistration in 12 regional languages, the web solution extended the issuance of digitally verifiable \\ncertificates. The Vaccination Certificate was designed at par with WHO Guidelines to assist even international travellers. To reduce the burden of registration hinging on a single document (Aadhaar), \\nthe Government allowed registration using any of the 10 photo identity cards [Aadhaar Card, Driving \\nLicense, PAN Card, Passport, Pension Passbook, NPR Smart Card, V oter ID, Unique Disability Identification Card,Ration Card with Photo, Student Photo ID card]. Tackling the problem of the \\ndigital divide and digital exclusion, multiple beneficiaries (up to six) were allowed onboarding using \\na single mobile number through the National Covid helpline. To ensure that those having limited access to physical facilities during times of Covid, either due to age, disability or identity, are not left \\nout, special provisions through the “Workplace Covid Vaccination Centre” in the Government and \\nprivate sector and also “Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres “ were made available.\\nThe present administration of more than 220 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses was made possible because \\nof the robust digital infrastructure of Co-WIN. It was this broad interlock of digital framework and \\nthe Government’s vigour of continuously improving its outreach for better inclusion that India could \\nregister a quick and durable economic recovery while continuing to secure both lives and livelihoods.  With more than 84.7 crore Co-WIN beneficiaries seeded with Aadhaar among the total 104 crore \\n(between January 2021 to September 2022), the seeds of JAM sown in FY15 proved to be a life saver \\nfor the nation.\\n48\\u2002https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4078488/199\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\nSocial protection for the rainy day\\n6.94\\u2003While growth can lift people out of the low-income trap, it may not be able to ensure that \\nthey no longer remain vulnerable to any crisis situations in their lifetime. Thus, it is important to protect citizens from risks posed by rainy days, such as health issues, natural disasters, old age, etc. Especially in the wake of the hardships posed by the pandemic, the government invested more resources in social protection programmes and continued to do so in the FY23 with the understanding that strong social protection systems can support the growth process.

The states/ UTs have taken up this \\nexercise to verify/ update the JCs. \\n(b)  As a good governance initiative, the number of Registers (average 22 Registers in a Gram \\nPanchayat) being maintained at every Gram Panchayat has been brought down to seven \\nRegisters.\\n(c)  Cases of violation of Guidelines and Schedules are being followed up regularly. The Interstate \\nStandard Operating Procedures (SoP) for visits were developed to improve the quality of the \\nsocial audit process for all the states/UTs. This SoP will ensure all the Social Audit compliance \\nas per Audit Standard Rule, 2011 which includes the establishment of an independent social audit unit, independent social audit director, and complete human resources to be trained as \\nVillage Resource Persons (VRPs), timely calendar upload on MIS, timely conduct of the \\nregular audit and uploading the issues on MIS within the stipulated timeline. \\n(d)\\n  MGNREGA workers are being trained under recent initiatives like Bare Foot Technicians (BFT) to move them up the skilling ladder.

With this target, the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana –Gramin (PMAY-G) was launched in November 2016 \\nwith the aim of providing around 3 crore pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible houseless households living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas by 2024. Through convergence with other Government Schemes, the PMAY-G also addresses basic needs such as the construction of the toilet, piped drinking water, electricity connection, LPG gas connection, and 90/95 person-days of unskilled labour from MGNREGS.\\n6.111\\u2003To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the \\nselection is objective and verifiable, PMAY-G selects beneficiaries using housing deprivation parameters in the SECC, 2011 date which is to be verified by the Gram Sabhas. Under the \\nscheme, landless beneficiaries are accorded the highest priority in the allotment of houses. A total of 2.7 crore houses have been sanctioned and 2.1 crore houses have been completed by 6 January 2023 under the Scheme. Against the total target of completion of 52.8 lakh houses in FY23, 32.4 lakh houses have been completed.\\n \\ndrinking Water and Sanitation\\n6.112\\u2003The UN-SDG6 aims to “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” India has made considerable progress in providing drinking water and safe sanitation to urban and rural households.

It envisaged the creation of basic electricity infrastructure in villages/habitations, strengthening & augmentation of existing infrastructure, and metering of existing feeders/distribution transformers/consumers to improve the quality and reliability of power supply in rural areas. Further, last-mile connectivity and free electricity connections were also provided to BPL households only identified by the States as per their list. \\n6.126\\u2003A total of 2.9 crore households have been electrified since the launch of the Saubhagya \\nperiod in October 2017 under various schemes viz (Saubhgaya, DDUGJY , etc.)212\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\ndirect benefit transfer: a game changer\\n6.127\\u2003The Economic Survey 2014-15 showed that although price subsidies are widely used \\nas part of a standard toolkit by Governments in India in their anti-poverty programmes, they are often regressive, distort the markets in ways that ultimately hurt the economically weak and the leakages thereof seriously undermine the effectiveness of price as well as product subsidies. These distortions and leakages are such that they have an adverse impact on social welfare. It was recommended that the benefit that price subsidies seek to create for the poor can be directly transferred to the poor through lump-sum income transfers, avoiding the distortions that price subsidies induce. Eliminating or phasing down subsidies is neither feasible nor desirable unless accompanied by other forms of support to cushion the poor and vulnerable and enable them to achieve their economic aspirations. The JAM Number Trinity – Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and Mobile numbers – has allowed the Government to offer this support to identified households in a targeted and less distortive way in the form of DBT.\\n6.128\\u2003Since the inception of DBT, cumulative transfers of over \\n`26.5 lakh crore in respect of \\nCentral schemes have been made through the DBT route. In this process, total savings of over \\n`2.2 lakh crore have accrued as on 31 March 2021 for Central schemes alone due to the removal \\nof 9.4 crore duplicate, fake/non-existent beneficiaries across databases. 6.129\\u2003With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the imposition of lockdown and \\nenforcement of social distancing norms, the DBT ecosystem faced a tough trial and emerged as a means of relief to millions of citizens whose livelihoods were impacted. DBT played a major role in sustaining life, especially for the underprivileged segments of society, helping millions by providing immediate relief. Cash transfers under central schemes like PM-KISAN, MGNREGS, National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), NRLM, National Health Mission (NHM), scholarship schemes of various ministries through the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) and food subsidy under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana and Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package were a big relief for all the adversely affected masses of India during the Covid-19 period.\\n6.130\\u2003To make DBT schemes more accessible and transparent, major DBT schemes are being \\nend-to-end digitized (EED) with provision for online and mobile-based access. 170 and 150 Central Government DBT schemes are EED and available on Unified Mobile Application for New Age Governance (UMANG) mobile platform respectively. Similarly, over 1000 States / UTs DBT schemes are EED. For citizens who do not have access to smartphones, services available on UMANG are also available in assisted mode through Common Service Centres (CSCs) across India. The citizen experience in accessing DBT schemes through the UMANG app is markedly rich since UMANG offers a well-catalogued bouquet of services in multiple Indian languages to cater to a wide audience.\\n6.131\\u2003India’s successful implementation of DBT has won praise from the International \\nMonetary Fund and World Bank, among other international organizations, for efficiently providing support (subsidies, food grain, and cash benefits directly) to large masses at low-income levels (85 per cent of rural households and 69 per cent of urban households).

The scheme extends to all states and UTs including non-Part IX of the Constitution of India areas where Panchayats do not exist. \\n6.134\\u2003The major focus of the scheme of RGSA was Capacity Building and Training (CB&T) to \\nempower PRIs and to prepare convergent Plans at the respective level of Panchayats. Under the Scheme, not only around 31 lakh elected representatives (ERs) have been capacitated through various modes of training but also functionaries and other stakeholders of Panchayats including SHG members have been provided training for better SHG-PRIs convergence at the grassroots level to create an ecosystem to prepare inclusive village poverty reduction plan. \\n6.135\\u2003The scheme has been revamped and approved in April 2022 for implementation over \\nthe period FY23 to FY26. The focus of the scheme of Revamped RGSA is on re-imagining PRIs as vibrant centres of local self-governance with a special focus on the Localisation of SDGs (LSDGs) at the grassroots level adopting thematic approach through concerted and collaborative efforts of Central Ministries and State line departments and other stakeholders with ‘Whole of Government and Whole of Society’ approach. The Scheme has been formulated with the aim to strengthen the capacities of institutions for rural local governance to become more responsive towards local development needs, prepare participatory plans leveraging technology, and efficiently utilise available resources for realising sustainable solutions to local problems linked to SDGs adopting the nine thematic approaches of LSDGs.\\n59 \\nSVamitV a Scheme \\n6.136\\u2003SV AMITV A (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village \\nAreas) is a Central Sector Scheme launched on 24 April 2020, the National Panchayati Raj Day. \\nThe scheme aims to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited rural areas. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loans; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning, which would be the stepping-stone towards achieving Gram Swaraj in the true sense and making rural India Atmanirbhar. The scheme aims to provide the following benefits:\\n• Creation of accurate land records for rural planning and reducing property-related disputes.\\n• To bring financial stability to the citizens in rural India by enabling them to use their property \\nas a financial asset for raising loans and other financial benefits.\\n• Determination of property tax, which would accrue to the Gram Panchayats directly in states where it is devolved or else, add to the state exchequer.\\n• Creation of survey infrastructure and GIS maps that can be leveraged by any department for their use.\\n59\\u2002Following are the themes for LSDGs: Poverty Free and Enhanced Livelihoods in Village; Healthy Village; Child-Friendly Village; Water \\nSufficient Village; Clean and Green Village; Village with Self-Sufficient Infrastructure; Socially Secured and Socially Just Village; Village with \\nGood Governance and Women Friendly Village.215\\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\\n• To support the preparation of a better-quality Gram Panchayat Development Plan by making \\nuse of GIS maps.\\n6.137\\u2003As on 31 December 2022, drone surveys have been completed in 2.15 lakh villages across the country, and saturated in the States of Haryana, Uttarakhand, Goa, and UT of Lakshadweep, A&N Islands, Delhi, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Daman & Diu.

The Hon’ble Prime Minister observed in 2015: \\n“The government must nurture an eco-system:– where the economy is primed for growth; and growth promotes all-round development;– where development is employment-generating; and employment is enabled by skills;– where skills are synced with production; and production is benchmarked to quality;– where quality meets global standards; and meeting global standards drives prosperityMost importanty, this prosperity is for the welfare of all ”\\n 60\\n6.139\\u2003Today, India is moving towards the attainment of the UN SDGs. While doing so, it \\nis cognisant of the fact that for equitable development, a country as vast and diverse as India requires the implementation of broad-based inclusive social policies, supported by adequate and commensurate financial resources. Thus, the character and contour of such an approach to development presents a unique set of challenges which is consistently being addressed in the form of mindful reforms. Ensuring that intended outcomes of social sector development schemes reach the intended, involvement of the grassroot level of governance is imperative and is being actively pursued. Technology has been a great enabler in ensuring the last-mile connectivity of government schemes to the targeted citizens. It has revolutionised the delivery of services while ensuring transparency and accountability. It needs to be harnessed further to help the government attain the lofty SDGs on the social front. \\n6.140\\u2003As India marches ahead, the ground lost as regards social sector improvements due \\nto the pandemic, has largely been recouped, powered by prompt policymaking and efficient implementation interwoven with technology. Going forward with the vision of ‘Minimum Government; Maximum Governance’, further developments will hold the key to attaining more equitable economic growth. Evident ones include stepping up learning outcomes through digital and teaching interventions in schools, enhancing the role of community workers in healthcare, pushing SHGs through better product design and upscaling enterprises. Further, channelising women’s economic potential through ecosystem services such as affordable market alternatives for care work, safe transportation and lodging, and long-term counselling support, can help capitalise the gender dividend for the country’s future economic and social development. \\n******\\n60\\u2002PM’s Inaugural address at Economic Times Global Business Summit, January 2015 https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?re -\\nlid=114728CHAPTER07\\nClimate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions, \\nboth historical and high per capita annual emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) of the developed countries. The global nature of the problem makes India one of the most vulnerable regions despite having contributed only about 4 per cent in the cumulative global emissions (for the period 1850-2019) and maintaining its per capita emission at far less than the world average. While India is less responsible for the high stock of emissions, however, it has consistently engaged in demonstrating global leadership towards adopting various measures and ensuring a low-emission growth pathway with a commitment to the net-zero emissions goal by 2070. \\nIndia has integrated the development goals with ambitious climate action goals, be it in \\nthe form of augmented solar power capacity (installed), higher energy saving targeting notified in P AT cycle-VII, improved green cover facilitated by Green India Mission, among other targeted Government actions. As part of dedicated efforts to preserve ecosystems, India now has 75 Ramsar sites for wetlands, in addition to various regulatory and promotional measures to protect and conserve mangroves. Continued river conservation and rejuvenation efforts are underway through Namami Gange and National River Conservation Plan (NRCP).\\nIn August 2022, the country updated the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) \\nin line with the Hon’ble PM’ s vision expressed in the 26th meeting of the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC. In terms of transition to renewable energy sources, India has already achieved its target of 40 per cent installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030. It has advanced the target to 50 per cent, which shall also translate to a significant reduction in the average emission rate. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047. Its pivotal role is also reflected in India’ s Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). \\nThe availability of adequate and affordable finance remains a constraint in India’ s climate \\nactions. The country has so far largely met its requirements from domestic sources only. Finance is a critical input for its climate actions. Therefore, the country has scaled up its efforts towards mobilising private capital, including through sovereign green bonds, to meet climate action goals. A framework for the latter has been issued in compliance with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (2021).\\nIndia’ s initiatives on the international stage have been noteworthy. The country has \\nactively engaged in global actions by championing the formation and strengthening of \\nvarious intergovernmental organisations. Climate Change and \\nenvironment: PreP aring \\nto FaCe the Future217\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\nintroduction\\n7.1 Climate change is the long-term change in temperature and weather patterns that can \\noccur due to natural reasons, but since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the 19th \\ncentury, it has been predominantly due to anthropogenic activities. GHG emissions remain in \\nthe atmosphere for tens to hundreds of years, trapping the sun’s heat from escaping. While within limits, these make our earth more habitable, allowing for salubrious weather conditions, the enhanced emissions have led to rising temperatures with the potential to bring about sea level rise, change monsoon cycles and impact land systems. \\n7.2 GHG emissions are the most significant threat to humanity and the inescapable reality the \\nworld faces. Action to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the changing climatic conditions are \\nrequired urgently as the world has already started to experience its consequences. For instance, it is estimated that by 2030, about 700 million people worldwide will be at risk of displacement by drought alone (U.N. SDG Portal). Thus, global warming is a reality, and so is climate change. Nor is there much doubt that human activity is primarily responsible for it this time, although climate change occurred in the distant past even when Planet Earth was scarcely populated. \\n7.3 Despite agreement on the above, there can still be much divergence about what comes next \\nand what to do about it when it comes to climate change. Much of the global angst associated \\nwith climate change is about the emission of GHGs and carbon, in particular. The more GHGs are emitted, the more they stay trapped in the atmosphere, accelerating global warming. Hence, the argument goes that if some of the cataclysmic consequences are to be avoided, then global warming must be arrested, slowed and, if possible, reversed. One way to strive for it is to reduce emissions of GHG, including carbon. Many nations pledge to reduce their net emission to zero by 2050. Some wish to achieve it by 2060 and by 2070.\\nFigure vii.1: net Zero Pledges of countries (the Year pledged is on top of the bars)\\n 2060 \\n203020352040204520502055206020652070Pledged Net -zero Year  \\n2050 2070  \\n2053 \\n2045 \\nSource: Emissions Gap Report 2022, UNEP218\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n7.4 However, this is where things begin to get interesting. Science is not very clear on \\nwhether further emission reduction would necessarily guarantee a stoppage or reversal of global \\nwarming.  The reason being much carbon dioxide and other GHGs have already been emitted over the last two and half centuries of industrialisation-led economic growth in today’s advanced nations, principally in North America and Europe. The share of developing countries in the stock of GHGs (usually measured as carbon dioxide equivalent) has been minimal compared to developed countries. This is corroborated by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which highlights that the challenges faced due to global warming are mainly due to cumulative historical and current GHG emissions of developed countries. The impact of the accumulation would also be iniquitous, with the developing countries not only bearing the brunt of climate change but also constrained by their capacity to respond to its challenges. The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) notes that high human vulnerability global hotspots are found particularly in West, Central & East Africa, South Asia, Central, and South America, Small Island Developing States, and the Arctic. \\n7.5 Further, as per the report, Asia is most vulnerable to climate change, especially to extreme \\nheat, flooding, sea level rise, and erratic rainfall. Ironically, the burden of adaptation is highest \\nfor those who have contributed the least to global warming. That unfortunate inevitability means that the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere may have already set a train of events that future emission reduction could do very little to stop or reverse. \\n7.6 Even if the answer to this question is unclear or unknown, some correctly argue that not \\ndoing whatever we can to make the planet more liveable and less dangerous may amount to \\ncriminal negligence. The problem is that the people and nations making this argument have their priorities correct for themselves but not for the countries yet to climb the ladder of prosperity. It is an enduring principle of economics that resources have competing uses and that there are always trade-offs. \\n7.7 Today’s developing nations are therefore caught in the horns of a dilemma. How much \\nresources to devote to bread-and-butter developmental priorities and to adapting to the already \\nchanging climate, and how much to dedicate to mitigating emissions of GHGs? Today’s developed nations have prospered through the unrestricted use of fossil fuels, including coal, crude oil, and natural gas. It is theoretically elegant to argue that switching to renewable or non-fossil fuel energy would generate investments and jobs. Still, it seldom works out so smoothly in practice. \\n7.8 For example, China has declared that future energy supplies, including alternative ones, \\nmust be secured first before dispensing with existing energy sources. Countries might find \\nthemselves not scrapping coal-fired power plants, and the alternatives may be held up either due to a lack of technology, financial resources, skilled and trained human resources, or some combination of all three. Countries have also learnt that the jobs that are likely to be created in the so-called ‘green economy’ are tilted towards skill and technology-intensive than in traditional industries.\\n1 One may also argue that it may be easier to speak of retraining and relocating people \\nthan actually doing so.\\n1\\u2002World Economic Outlook, October 2021, Ch.1 World Economic Outlook, October 2021: Recovery During A Pandemic (imf.org)219\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\n7.9 Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling (2005) argued that the most effective way to combat \\nclimate change was to let nations grow first2:\\n“If per capita income growth in the next 40 years compares with the 40 years just past, \\nvulnerability to climate change should diminish, and the resources available for adaptation should be greater. I say this not to minimise concern about climate change but to anticipate whether developing countries should make sacrifices in their development to minimise the emission of gases that may change the climate to their disadvantage. Their best defence against climate change may be their own continued development.”\\n7.10 That economic growth would enable resource generation will come as no surprise to \\nstudents of corporate finance. Companies generate profits and internal resources and thus fund \\ntheir investments. For companies worldwide, the single biggest source of finance for their capital investments is their own resources before they turn to markets. That would work for nations too. \\n7.11 Another reason why it is a realistic proposition is that securing funding from either \\ndeveloped nations or multilateral organisations is rather difficult. Public finances in developed \\ncountries are stretched and do not seem to have the intent to mobilise adequate resources for climate action in developing countries. They also do not have the appetite to provide additional capital to multilateral institutions for them to be able to lend more or mobilise greater resources. Further, the willingness and incentives-alignment of the private sector to undertake long-gestation projects are questionable at best or non-existent at worst. \\n7.12 Lastly, it does not seem so strange or irresponsible that developing countries must put \\ntheir own growth and development aspirations ahead of their global climate obligations when \\none considers that developed countries set aside their obsessive concerns about climate change and global warming to burn more coal to generate electricity this year. Aiming to reduce their dependence on Russian crude oil and natural gas, countries in Europe had to switch to coal to keep their homes warm and well-lit\\n3. The behaviour of European nations in 2022, eminently \\nunderstandable, demonstrates the return of energy security as a prime requirement for countries. Therefore, it stands to reason that it would be no different for developing economies too.\\n7.13 Earlier in the year, the OECD and the Social Economics Lab at Harvard teamed up \\nto understand why policies to address climate change have been difficult to implement and \\nsurveyed over 40,000 respondents across 20 of the world’s most carbon-emitting countries (representing 72 per cent of global CO\\n2 emissions). The findings were striking4. In general, \\ncitizens in developed countries expressed considerable reluctance to change their lifestyles and habits with respect to driving, flying and eating that would contribute to reduced emissions. Policies to implement carbon pricing have not been easy in all European countries. France tried and retreated in 2018. Switzerland’s proposal was defeated in a referendum in 2021. \\n2\\u2002Thomas C.

The problem is that they are produced in a few countries and processed in even fewer countries. A globally synchronised energy transition to non-fossil fuels might be difficult to pull off if adequate REE and CM are not available. That would leave the fossil fuel-based assets stranded for many countries’ economies!\\n7.15 Jean Pisani-Ferry, associated with the Bruegel Institute and an advisor to the French \\nGovernment, has begun to sound the alarm about climate change’s significant short-run \\nmacroeconomic costs. Citing him in his article for the International Monetary Fund’s ‘Finance and Development’, Daniel Yergin writes\\n6,\\n“The economist Jean Pisani-Ferry, cofounder of Bruegel, Europe’ s leading economic think tank, has observed that accelerating the targets for net carbon emission reductions too aggressively could create much larger economic disruptions than generally anticipated—what he called “an adverse supply shock—very much like the shocks of the 1970s.” Such a transition, Pisani-Ferry presciently wrote in 2021, just before the current energy crisis began, is “unlikely to be benign and policymakers should get ready for tough choices.” He subsequently added, in 2022: “Climate action has become a major macroeconomic issue, but the macroeconomics of climate action is far from the level of rigour and precision that is now necessary to provide a sound basis for public discussions and to guide policymakers adequately. For understandable reasons, advocacy has too often taken precedence over analysis. But at this stage of the discussion, complacent scenarios have become counterproductive. The policy conversation now needs methodical, peer-examined assessments of the potential costs and benefits of alternative plans for action. ”\\n7.16 However, whether we like it or not, the climate change issue will be increasingly relevant \\nand will occupy the airwaves and the attention of policymakers. Countries, even if they wait for financial, technological and human resources for emissions mitigation, have to take action to make their people resilient and adapt to climate change. So, actions on multiple fronts are needed, including the estimation of resources, lifestyle adjustments etc.\\n7.17 Here, India, considered to be one of the most vulnerable countries given its long coastline, \\nmonsoon-dependent agriculture, and large agrarian economy, is one of the leading examples of \\nthis. It has contributed only 4 per cent (until 2019) to the cumulative global emissions and its per capita emission is far less than the world average.\\n7.18 The fact that climate change is a global phenomenon and requires collective efforts has \\nbeen widely accepted and is the basis of the commitments in the United Nations Framework \\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement.

It spearheads one \\nof the most robust climate actions through its NDCs, which includes an ambitious programme \\nfor transitions to clean energy in the world. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, the country has enhanced its climate ambition manifold and embarked on a long-term strategy towards a low GHG emission based development.  \\n7.20 Having set the context, this chapter presents an updated discussion on the issue of climate \\nchange from India’s perspective, including a discussion on forests and their role in mitigating \\ncarbon emissions, an approach to transition to renewable energy and the recently submitted low emissions development strategy. The chapter further presents a discussion on the outcomes of the 27\\nth session of the Conference of Parties (COP 27), progress made on enabling financing for \\nsustainable development and India’s role in global efforts towards addressing climate change. Besides this, recent changes in environmental regulations and other environmental aspects, such as biodiversity and wildlife, are also discussed.\\nProgress on india’s Climate action\\n7.21 India’s climate vision is integrally linked to its vision of development that foregrounds \\nthe goals of poverty eradication and guaranteeing basic well-being to all its citizens. Action on addressing climate action was initiated even before the Paris Agreement came into being. In 2008, India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), establishing eight National Missions, covering several initiatives and a slew of measures in the area of solar, water, energy efficiency, forests, sustainable habitat, sustainable agriculture, sustaining Himalayan ecosystem, capacity building and research and development (R&D).\\nFigure vii.2: Progress on eight national missions of the naPCC highlighting achievements \\nacross various domains\\n •Solar power capacity of 61.62 GW  installed by \\nOctober 2022  \\nNational Solar Mission  \\n•PAT Cycle –VII notified in October 2021 for energy \\nsaving target of 6.63 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent \\n(MTOE)  \\nNational Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency  \\n•721 km of metro  rail network  made  operational  by \\nAugust  2022. \\n•62.79 lakh individual  household  toilets and 6.21 lakh \\ncommunity  and public  toilets constructed  by April  \\n2022 \\nNational Mission on \\nSustainable Habitat  \\n•₹ 626.96 crore for afforestation targets over an area of 2.1 lakh ha   \\n National Mission for a Green \\nIndia  \\n•Jal Shakti  Abhiyan:  Catch  The Rain  2022 \\n National Water Mission  \\n•Created and strengthened 12 Centres of Excellence for climate change (June 2021)  \\n National Mission on Strategic \\nKnowledge for Climate Change  \\n•Inter -University Consortium  \\n•8 Major R&D Programmes initiated  \\nNational Mission for Sustaining \\nHimalayan Ecosystems  \\n•Key targets  for FY 2022 -2023 covering  0.15 lakh \\nha under  organic  farming  and 10 lakh ha under  micro  \\nirrigation  \\nNational Mission for \\nSustainable Agriculture  222\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n7.22 National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), a central sector scheme, was \\ninitiated in 2015-16 to support adaptation activities in the States and Union Territories (UTs) \\nof India that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. NAFCC is implemented in project mode, and to date, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States and UTs with a total project cost of ₹847.5 crore. NAFCC supports adaptation action, in, inter alia, agriculture, water, forestry, livestock, and restoring ecosystems. At present (November 2022), 28 projects are under implementation. \\n7.23 Demonstrating higher ambition in its climate action, the Government of India submitted \\nits updated NDC on August 26, 2022. The new NDC with enhanced targets translates the vision \\nof the Hon’ble PM expressed through the “Panchamrit” at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties \\n(COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021. The vision mentions of sustainable lifestyles and climate justice to protect the poor and vulnerable from the adverse impacts of climate change. Aligning with this vision, the share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity in overall capacity has risen rapidly over time.  Including the large hydro, the share of non-fossil sources in total installed electricity capacity is estimated to be about 40.4 per cent (on 31.09.2022) compared to 27.3 per cent in 2014-15. This period has seen a sizeable enhancement in the share of installed electricity capacity in solar and wind energy from 8.9 per cent in 2014-15 to 25.1 per cent in 2022-23 (April-Sept).\\nBox vii.1: india’s updated nationally determined Contribution (ndC)\\nIndia submitted its first NDC to UNFCCC in October 2015. This was updated in August 2022. The \\n2015 NDC comprised eight goals, three of which were quantitative targets to be achieved up to 2030. \\nThe three targets included cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources to \\nreach 40 per cent, reduction in the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 per cent compared to 2005 levels, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO\\n2 equivalent through \\nadditional forest and tree cover. \\nArticle 4 of the Paris Agreement provides that each Party shall communicate or update its NDC \\nevery five years. Therefore, in accordance with the aforesaid provision of the Paris Agreement, India \\nsubmitted the following updates to its first NDC of 2015.\\n1.  To put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions \\nand values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for ‘LIFE’– ‘Lifestyle for Environment’ as a key to combating climate change. \\n2.  To adopt a climate-friendly and cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at the \\ncorresponding level of economic development.\\n3.  To reduce the Emissions Intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from the 2005 level. \\n4.  To achieve about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil \\nfuel-based energy resources by 2030, with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost \\ninternational finance, including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). 223\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\n5.  To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through \\nadditional forest and tree cover by 2030. \\n6.  To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in \\nsectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, the Himalayan \\nregion, coastal regions, and health and disaster management. \\n7.  To mobilise domestic and new & additional funds from developed countries to implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required and the resource gap. \\n8.  To build capacities and create a domestic framework and international architecture for quick diffusion of cutting-edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R&D for such \\nfuture technologies.\\nSource: Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change\\nStatus of Forest and tree Cover\\n7.24 One of the three quantifiable targets of India’s NDC is to achieve an additional carbon sink \\nof 2.5 billion to 3.0 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The forest \\nand tree cover in India has shown a gradual and steady trend of increase in the last one and a half decades.\\n7.25 The country ranks third globally with respect to the net gain in average annual forest area \\nbetween 2010 and 2020. This gain is mainly attributed to the robust framework and policies of \\nthe National and State Governments that have promoted and safeguarded forests. Schemes like the Green India Mission (GIM), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green Highway Policy - 2015, Policy for enhancement of Urban Greens, National Agro-forestry Policy, and Sub-Mission on Agro-forestry (SMAF), etc. are among the most important ones. \\nCarbon Stock in india’s Forest and tree Cover\\n7.26 A robust forest ecosystem is a vital sink of carbon.  Forest Survey of India (FSI) assessed \\nthe carbon stock (which is the amount of carbon sequestrated from the atmosphere and stored in biomass, deadwood, soil, and litter in the forest) in India’s forests for the first time in 2004 and then biennially since 2011. The Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR) estimates the carbon stock of forests to be about 7,204 million tonnes in 2019\\n7, which is an increase of 79.4 million \\ntonnes of carbon stock as compared to the estimates of the previous assessment for 2017. This translates into carbon emissions sequestrated through forest and tree cover to be 30.1 billion tonnes of CO\\n2 equivalent. \\n7\\u2002ISFR-2021. https://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2021-details 224\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure vii.3: Carbon stock in forests in india has been rising\\n 6941 7044 7082 7125  7204 \\n69006950700070507100715072007250\\n2011\\n(ISFR-2013)2013\\n(ISFR-2015)2015\\n(ISFR-2017)2017\\n(ISFR-2019)2019\\n(ISFR-2021)Carbon stock (million tonnes)  \\nSource: Based on data of the Forest Survey of India\\n7.27 Among the Indian States, Arunachal Pradesh has the maximum carbon stock in forests \\n(1023.84 million tonnes), followed by Madhya Pradesh (609.25 million tonnes). The per-hectare \\nforest carbon stock among different States/UTs indicates that Jammu & Kashmir is contributing the maximum per-hectare carbon stock of 173.41 tonnes, followed by Himachal Pradesh (167.0 tonnes), Sikkim (166.2 tonnes) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (162.9 tonnes).\\nPreservation of ecosystems: a  Critical adaptation action \\n7.28 Ecosystems play an important role in carbon storage, protect the coastal areas, and \\nenhance water quality besides other services, such as cultural, spiritual or tourist attractions. \\nWetlands are natural buffers against floods, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Wetlands can act as sponges, storing peak rainfall and releasing water gradually during the lean season. The floods in Kashmir Valley in September 2014 and Chennai city in December 2015 are reminders of the ways wetland destruction can make lives vulnerable. The Ramsar Convention, signed on February 2, 1971, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accords signed by member countries to preserve the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance. Wetlands declared as Ramsar sites are protected. India has 75 Ramsar sites covering an area of 13.3 lakh ha, and 49 of these have been added in the last 8 years. \\n7.29 Mangroves and coastal wetlands form the first line of defence for coastal communities \\nagainst increased storm surges, flooding, and hurricanes. As per a recent study, certain mangrove \\nspecies in Chilika and Sundarbans along the east coast and Dwarka and Porbandar along the west coast of India are likely to reduce and shift landward by 2070 due to a decline in suitable habitats in response to precipitation and sea level changes.\\n8 \\n7.30 The Government has taken both regulatory and promotional measures to protect and \\nconserve mangroves. The National Coastal Mission Programme on ‘Conservation and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs’ is being implemented.

A recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (2020)\\n10 suggests that the cost of electrolysers is crucial \\nfor making green hydrogen economically viable. The report also underscores the importance of innovation in electrolyser technology and the rapid increase in its scale of production as the main factors that would drive down the cost of electrolysers and green hydrogen. \\n7.40 NITI’s report estimates that the cumulative value of the green hydrogen market in India \\nwill be US$ 8 billion by 2030 and US$ 340 billion by 2050.

This is because an energy system powered by clean energy technologies differs profoundly \\nfrom one fuelled by traditional hydrocarbon resources. Cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, and rare earth \\nelements (REEs) are critical for producing electric vehicles and batteries and harnessing solar power and wind energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, wind farms and electric vehicles (EVs) generally \\nrequire more minerals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. A typical electric car requires six times \\nthe mineral inputs of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineral \\nresources than a gas-fired plant\\n12.\\nThe types of mineral resources used vary by technology. Lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite are crucial to battery performance, longevity and energy density. REEs are essential for permanent \\nmagnets that are vital for wind turbines and EV motors. Electricity networks need a huge amount of copper and aluminium, with copper being a cornerstone for all electricity-related technologies.\\nWhile the demand for critical minerals is set to increase because of the global preference and emphasis \\ntowards renewable energy, the global supply chain of the critical minerals is highly concentrated and unevenly distributed. The skewed distribution of the resource poses a supply risk in the face of its \\nenhanced demand.  \\n11\\u2002LCOH refers to the cost of hydrogen production per unit of hydrogen includind capital and operational costs.  \\n12\\u2002International Energy Agency Report on ‘The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions’.

The country has resources of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and heavy REEs, \\nbut further exploration would be needed to evaluate the quantities of their reserves. There is a need to \\ncreate strategic mineral reserves along the lines of strategic petroleum reserves to ensure a continuous supply of minerals. Also, policies should consider investing in internal research including technological \\ninnovation for mineral exploration and processing and the development of Recycling, Reusing, and \\nRepurposing (R3) technologies.\\n In order to ensure the mineral security of the nation and to attain self-reliance in the area of critical and \\nstrategic minerals, the Ministry of Mines has created a Joint Venture company, namely Khanij Bidesh \\nIndia Ltd (KABIL), with participating interests of NALCO, HCL and MECL. KABIL is mandated to \\nidentify and acquire overseas mineral assets of critical and strategic nature, such as Lithium, Cobalt etc. Further, the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the Department of Industry, Science, Energy \\nand Resources (DISER), Government of Australia, signed an MoU on June 3, 2020 for cooperation in \\nthe field of mining and processing of critical and strategic minerals.  Further, KABIL has also signed \\na detailed MoU with a collaborative framework with the Critical Minerals Facilitation Office under \\nthe DISER on March 10, 2022 to identify lithium and cobalt mineral assets for final joint investment decisions and acquisition of the assets in Australia catering to the critical and strategic ecosystem of \\nboth the countries.\\nlong-t erm low emissions development Strategy (lt -ledS) \\n7.42 India submitted its Long-Term Low Carbon Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) on \\nNovember 14, 2022, at COP 27. The salient features of LT-LEDS are: \\n• Focus on the rational utilisation of national resources with due regard to energy security. \\nThe transitions from fossil fuels will be undertaken in a just, smooth, sustainable and all-inclusive manner. \\n• Encompasses the objectives of the National Hydrogen Policy. The rapid expansion of green hydrogen production, increasing electrolyser manufacturing capacity in the country, and a 231\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\nthree-fold increase in nuclear capacity by 2032 are some of the other milestones that are \\nenvisaged alongside the overall development of the power sector.\\n• Increased use of biofuels, especially ethanol blending in petrol. The drive to increase electric vehicle penetration, and the increased use of green hydrogen fuel are expected to drive the low carbon development of the transport sector. India aspires to maximise the use of electric vehicles, ethanol blending to reach 20 per cent by the Ethanol Supply Year 2025-26, and a strong modal shift to public transport for passengers and freight.\\n• Climate-resilient urban development will be driven by smart city initiatives, integrated planning of cities for mainstreaming adaptation and enhancing energy and resource efficiency, effective green building codes and developments in innovative solid and liquid waste management.\\n• India’s industrial sector will continue on a strong growth path, with the vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Make in India’ .\\n7.43 LT-LEDS has been prepared in the framework of India’s right to an equitable and fair \\nshare of the global carbon budget and is the practical implementation of India’s call for “climate justice.” This is essential to ensure that there are no constraints on realising India’s vision of rapid growth and economic transformation while protecting the environment. The LT-LEDS is driven by the vision of LiFE, Lifestyle for the Environment that calls for a worldwide paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation. Here, the transition to low carbon development pathway will entail costs. In addition, the provision for climate finance by developed countries will play a very significant role and, therefore, needs to be considerably enhanced in the form of grants and concessional loans. \\nFinance for Sustainable development\\n7.44 Finance is a critical input in India’s climate actions. The country’s climate actions have \\nso far been largely financed from domestic sources, including government budgetary support, a mix of market mechanisms, fiscal instruments, and policy interventions. India has shown global leadership in the fight against climate change and has committed itself to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. While several estimates of the required investments are indicated in the LT-LEDS report prepared by India, it is important to note that all allude to a need for tens of trillions of US dollars.  \\n7.45 The understanding in the Convention and the Paris Agreement has been that the developed \\ncountries will mobilise the resources through public and other sources, including by catalysing \\nprivate finance to enable a flow of financial resources at a reasonable cost. While these are yet to materialise, India has scaled up its efforts towards greater mobilisation of private capital to meet its ambitious climate action goals. \\ngreen Bonds \\n7.46 Green bonds are financial instruments that generate proceeds for investment in \\nenvironmentally sustainable and climate-suitable projects. With the growing focus on the environmental sustainability of projects, green bonds have become widely accepted as an 232\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\ninstrument to raise funds to support climate and environmental projects and command a relatively \\nlower cost of capital vis-à-vis regular bonds. Major countries that resorted to green bonds to raise funds include the UK, France, Germany, the USA, and China. IMF data indicates that green bonds of value around US$ 620 billion were issued across the world in the year 2021, in which countries issued green bonds of value US$ 587.7 billion and international organisations issued bonds of value US$ 32.3 billion. As per SEBI’s data on green debt securities, during the period of 2017 to September 2022, 15 Indian corporates have issued green bonds of value ₹4,539 crore.  Most of these are related to renewable energy generation, while one is slated to be used for the tertiary treatment of wastewater.\\nFigure vii.12: Status of Sovereign green Bond issuances in 2021 \\n 21.7 \\n16.1 15.3 14.2 \\n8.8 \\n5.7 \\n2.3 0.8 0.5 0.4 \\n0510152025\\nUnited\\nKingdomFrance Italy Germany China,\\nP.R.:\\nHong\\nKongSpain Serbia,\\nRep. ofKorea,\\nRep. ofHungary ColombiaUS$ billion  \\nSource: IMF Climate Change Dashboard\\n7.47 In keeping with the ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy significantly, \\nthe Union Budget 2022-23 announced the issue of Sovereign Green Bonds. The issuance of \\nSovereign Green Bonds will help the government to tap the requisite finance from potential investors for deployment in public sector projects aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of the economy. The final Sovereign Green Bonds framework of India has been issued. The Framework has been designed to comply with the components and key recommendations of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (2021). \\n7.48 A Green Finance working committee has also been set up to oversee and validate key \\ndecisions on the issuance of Sovereign green bonds. The committee has the mandate to select \\nthe projects for allocation of proceeds, do a time-bound review of the allocation and carry out annual reporting along with an impact assessment of the proceeds from sovereign green bonds issued. \\n7.49 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has notified the indicative calendar for the issuance of \\nSovereign Green Bonds (SGrBs) for the fiscal year 2022-23. The issuance would take place \\nthrough two auctions on January 25, 2023 and February 9, 2023, respectively, for ₹8,000 crore each, totalling ₹16,000 crore. The security-wise allocation would include 5 year and 10 year SGrBs for ₹4,000 crore each for both auctions. Five per cent of the notified amount of sale has been reserved for retail investors as specified under the ‘Scheme for Non-competitive Bidding Facility in the auction of Government of India Dated Securities and Treasury Bills’. The SGrBs will be designated as specified securities under the ‘Fully Accessible Route’ for investment in Government Securities by non-residents. Over time, the SGrBs would provide a pricing 233\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\nreference for private sector entities in India for their domestic borrowings through Environment, \\nSocial, and Governance (ESG) bonds. Thus, the issuance of SGrBs would help in creating an ecosystem which fosters a greater flow of capital into green projects and entities undertaking such projects.\\nregulatory Framework for issuance of green debt Securities\\n7.50 On November 3, 2021, the RBI published its ‘Statement of Commitment to Support \\nGreening India’s Financial System’ - NGFS. Here, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) laid out, keeping in view its national commitments, priorities, and complexity of our financial system, committed to, among others, exploring how climate scenario exercises can be used to identify vulnerabilities in RBI-supervised entities’ balance sheets, business models and gaps in their capabilities for measuring and managing climate-related financial risks. Also, in 2007, the RBI advised banks to put in place an appropriate action plan for making a meaningful contribution to sustainable development. Over time, RBI has incentivised bank lending towards greener industries and projects. For example, renewable energy projects have been included under Priority Sector Lending (PSL). The RBI has also been spreading awareness on the issue of green and sustainable finance by discussing the opportunities and challenges of green finance through its publications and other communication.\\n7.51 SEBI introduced the regulatory framework for issuance of green debt securities as a \\nmode of sustainable finance under the erstwhile SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) \\nRegulations, 2008, (ILDS Regulations) , vide circular dated May 30, 2017. \\n7.52 At the time of review of the ILDS Regulations, the provisions of the erstwhile circular \\nwere subsumed, and the definition of “green debt security” was incorporated as Regulation 2(1)(q) in the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Securities) Regulations, 2021 (‘NCS Regulations’ ). The disclosure requirements were prescribed vide Operational Circular dated \\nAugust 10, 2021. \\n7.53 Recently, vide a circular dated November 24, 2022, SEBI has allowed an issuer under the \\nSEBI (Issue and Listing of Municipal Debt Securities) Regulations, 2015 (‘ILMDS Regulations’) \\nto issue a green debt security if it falls within the definition of “green debt security” as per Regulation 2(1)(q) of the NCS Regulations. Such an issuer has to comply with both ILMDS Regulation and NCS Regulations. \\n7.54 In the backdrop of increasing interest in sustainable finance in India as well as around \\nthe globe, and with a view to aligning the extant framework for green debt securities with \\nthe updated Green Bond Principles recognised by International Organisation of Securities Commission (IOSCO), SEBI undertook a review of the regulatory framework for green debt securities. Based on the review, it has been decided in the SEBI board meeting dated December 20, 2022, to:\\na.

Over the years, the requirement was strengthened to cover the top 500 and then the top 1000 entities. SEBI has issued new sustainability reporting requirements under the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), which are more granular with quantifiable metrics in line with the principles ensconced in the ‘National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct’. The BRSR was made mandatory for the top 1000 listed entities (by market capitalisation) from 2022–23. Early research show that for top Indian firms, ESG performance reduced stock return volatility during Covid-19\\n13 and enabled firms to access \\ncapital at lower cost by building investors’ confidence as ESG disclosures create long-term value for investors as well as reduce information asymmetry\\n14. \\nmajor decisions at CoP 27\\n7.56 The COP 27 to the UNFCCC was held from 6 to 20 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, \\nEgypt. In conjunction with COP 27, the 17th Session of the Conference of Parties serving as the \\nmeeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP17), the 4th Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of Parties to Paris Agreement (CMA4), 57th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) were also held.\\n7.57 India participated in COP 27, with a focus on mainstreaming the theme of LiFE - Lifestyle \\nfor Environment. The Indian Pavilion at COP 27 highlighted the theme of LiFE in various ways \\n– models, audio-visual displays, activities, and 49 side events. India invited all countries to join the LiFE movement, which is a pro-people and pro-planet effort seeking to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation of natural resources. \\n7.58 The cover decision of COP 27, titled the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, notes the \\n‘importance of the transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption \\nand production for efforts to address climate change’. Other decisions were setting up the Just Transition and Mitigation Work Program and the agreement on Joint work on the implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security to be conducted over four years.\\n7.59 During COP 27, developing nations strongly voiced setting up a separate fund for loss and \\ndamage. After negotiations, it was decided to establish new funding arrangements for assisting \\ndeveloping countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to loss and damage, with a focus on addressing loss and damage. A transitional committee has been established to work out the modalities.\\n13\\u2002Beloskar, V . D., & Rao, S. V . D. (2022). Did ESG Save the Day? Evidence from India During the Covid-19 Crisis.

The COP 21 decided that, prior to 2025, a New Collective Quantified Goal \\n(NCQG) on climate finance from a floor of US$ 100 billion per year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries, shall be set. To further the agenda of setting the NCQG by 2024, COP 27 decided that Four Technical Expert Dialogues (TEDs) will be carried out prior to COP 28. \\nindia’s initiatives at the international Stage \\ninternational Solar alliance (iSa)\\n7.62 The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation \\nworking to create a global market system to tap the benefits of solar power and promote clean energy applications. ISA’s mission is to unlock US$ 1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing. With the signing and ratification of the ISA Framework Agreement by 15 countries on 6 December 2017, ISA became the first international intergovernmental organisation to be headquartered in India.  ISA is partnering with multilateral development banks (MDBs), development financial institutions (DFIs), private and public sector organisations, civil society, and other international institutions to deploy cost-effective and transformational solutions through solar energy, especially in the least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS).\\n7.63 The ISA has expanded its coverage to all its 110 member countries. It assists them with the \\nadoption of solar energy with the view to improving energy access, ensuring energy security and \\nfacilitating the energy transition. Through the programmatic support offered by ISA, a pipeline of 9.5 GW of solar energy capacity has been identified in its member countries, including large-scale solar parks in multiple developing countries. In its member countries, with a grant of US$ 50,000, ISA is assisting in setting up solar energy demonstration projects. Three such demonstration projects were inaugurated at the Fifth Assembly of ISA.\\nCoalition for disaster resilient infrastructure\\n7.64 The CDRI was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India during the United Nations \\nClimate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 in New York. It is a global partnership of National Governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and academic and knowledge institutions. It aims to promote the resilience of infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainable development.236\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n7.65 As on 29 June 2022, thirty-one Countries, six International Organisations and two \\nprivate sector organisations have joined as members of CDRI.  CDRI has been expanding its \\nmembership consistently by attracting a wide variety of economically advanced countries, developing countries, and countries that are most vulnerable to climate change and disasters. Over a period, a network of organisations/stakeholders will be developed to advance disaster-resilient infrastructure not only in India but in other partner countries as well.\\nleadership group for industry transition (leadit)\\n7.66 The LeadIT gathers countries and companies that are committed to action to achieve the \\nParis Agreement. It was launched by the governments of Sweden and India at the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019 and is supported by the World Economic Forum. LeadIT members subscribe to the notion that energy-intensive industries can and must progress on low-carbon pathways, aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.\\n7.67 During COP 27, LeadIT members adopted a joint statement wherein members collectively \\nagreed to:  (i)  promote value chain partnerships and material circularity;\\n(ii)  invest and cooperate on the planning and implementation of infrastructure to support \\nenergy and industry transitions; \\n(iii)  give multilateral development banks and multilateral climate funds mandates to de-risk investments in the transition of heavy industries in emerging and developing countries;\\n(iv)  formulate roadmaps for heavy industry sectors that include regulatory frameworks, incentives, and long-term strategies, to facilitate transition finance and attract private investments.\\ninitiatives related to other environmental issues\\nensuring the Conservation of Biodiversity\\n7.68 Conservation of biodiversity is crucial as it provides resources and services necessary for \\nhuman beings and for the sustenance of all living beings. It enhances ecosystem productivity, where each species, however small, has an important role to play. May 22\\nnd is celebrated as \\nan International Day for Biological Diversity every year globally to create awareness among the citizens and stakeholders on the importance and need for the conservation of biological diversity.\\n7.69 India ranks eighth in the world and fourth in Asia among the mega-diverse countries in \\nthe world. It is also rich in fauna, and nearly 62 per cent of the recorded amphibian species are \\nendemic to India, which is majorly found in the Western Ghats. Globally, India holds the eighth position for the origin and diversity of crop plants, as it has more than 300 wild ancestors and close relatives of cultivated plants growing naturally. Notably, around 9,500 plant species are used as medicine in indigenous health practices. Moreover, local and indigenous people use more than 3,900 plant species as food, fibre, fodder, insecticides and pesticides, gum, resins, dyes, perfumes, and timber.237\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\n7.70 The 1992 Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro led to the adoption of an internationally \\nbinding legal instrument, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the objectives \\nof conservation, sustainable use, and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of biological diversity. The fifteenth meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) took place between 7\\nth and 19th December 2022 in \\nMontreal, Canada. Key outcomes of the COP 15 include-\\n• Effective conservation and management of at least 30 per cent of the world’s lands, inland \\nwaters, coastal areas, and oceans. Currently, 17 per cent and 10 per cent of the world’s terrestrial and marine areas are under protection.\\n• Reduce to near zero the loss of areas of high biodiversity importance.\\n• Cut global food waste in half and significantly reduce overconsumption and waste generation.\\n• Reduce by half both excess nutrients and the overall risk posed by pesticides and highly hazardous chemicals.\\n• Progressively phasing out or reforming subsidies that harm biodiversity by 2030 by at least \\nUS$500 billion per year while scaling up positive incentives for biodiversity’s conservation and sustainable use. \\n• Mobilise by 2030 at least US$ 200 billion per year in domestic and international biodiversity-related funding from all sources – public and private.\\n• Raise international financial flows from developed to developing countries, in particular, least developed countries, small-island developing States, and countries with economies in transition, to at least US$ 20 billion per year by 2025 and to at least US$ 30 billion per year by 2030.\\n7.71 In conformity with the spirit of the CBD, India enacted the Biological Diversity Act in \\n2002.  The Act mandates the implementation of the objectives through a decentralised system with the National Biodiversity Authority at the national level, the State Biodiversity Boards at the State level, and Biodiversity Management Committees at the local body level.  Each of these entities is a statutory and autonomous body with specific mandates and powers to facilitate the effective implementation of the provisions of the Act and the Rules.\\n7.72 India and Nepal signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in August 2022 on \\nbiodiversity conservation to strengthen and enhance the coordination and cooperation in the \\nfield of forests, wildlife, environment, biodiversity conservation, and climate change, including restoration of corridors and interlinking areas and sharing knowledge and best practices between the two countries. The MoU would help promote cooperation between the Parties in the field of forests, wildlife, environment, biodiversity conservation, and climate change, including restoration of corridors and interlinking areas and sharing knowledge and best practices.238\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nBox vii.3: Project Cheetah\\nThe introduction of Cheetahs in India is being done under Project Cheetah, the world’s first inter-\\ncontinental large wild carnivore translocation project. The cheetah was declared extinct from India \\nin 1952. Under the scheme, eight Namibian wild cheetahs were introduced on 17 September 2022 \\nin Kuno National Park, Madhya Pradesh. Out of the eight Cheetahs, there are five female and three male Cheetahs.\\nThe historic reintroduction of Cheetahs in India is part of a long series of measures for ensuring \\nsustainability and environmental protection. Cheetahs can help restore open forest and grassland ecosystems in India. This will help conserve biodiversity and enhance the ecosystem services like \\nwater security, carbon sequestration, and soil moisture conservation, benefiting society. This effort, \\nin line with the Prime Minister’s commitment to environmental protection and wildlife conservation, \\nwill also lead to enhanced livelihood opportunities for the local community through eco-development \\nand ecotourism activities.\\nThe Government has constituted a Task Force for monitoring Cheetah introduction. The Task Force \\nshall be in force for a period of two years. The Task Force has been formed to:\\n• Review, progress, and monitor the health status of Cheetah, upkeep of the quarantine & soft \\nrelease enclosures, protection status of the entire area, adherence to the defined protocols by \\nforest & veterinary officials, and advice on Cheetah introduction in India concerning overall \\nhealth, behaviour and their upkeep.\\n• Monitor hunting skills and adaptation of Cheetahs to the habitat of Kuno National Park.\\n• Monitor the release of Cheetah from Quarantine bomas to soft-release enclosures, grassland, and \\nopen forest areas.\\n• Open Cheetah habitat for eco-tourism and suggest regulations in this regard.\\n• Suggest and advise on developing tourism infrastructure in the fringe areas of Kuno National Park and other Protected Areas.\\nWildlife - its Preservation and Protection\\n7.73 India has a rich heritage of wildlife and a long history and tradition of conservation. The \\nconcern for wildlife is, indeed, the concern for the man himself. All forms of life – human, \\nanimal and plants are so closely interlinked that disturbance in one leads to an imbalance in others. A comprehensive legislation was enacted in 1972 called the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 to provide special legal protection to our wildlife and the endangered species of fauna. \\n7.74 Animals such as tigers, lions, and elephants are keystone and flagship species whose \\npreservation benefits the entire ecosystems. As of 10 August 2022, India is home to 53 Tiger \\nReserves covering approximately 75,796.8 sq. km area in 18 States, with about 75 per cent of the wild tiger population at the global level. India achieved the goal of doubling the tiger numbers in 2018, four years before the targeted year 2022.  In addition, 17 Tiger Reserves in the country have CA|TS international accreditation, and two have received International Tx2 Award\\n15.\\n15\\u2002The TX2 Tiger Conservation Award is given away by Conservation Assured | Tiger Standards (CA|TS), Fauna & Flora International, Global \\nTiger Forum, IUCN Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme, Panthera, UNDP Lion’s Share, Wildlife Conservation Society, and World Wide Fund For Nature’s (WWF’s) Tigers Alive Initiative.239\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\n7.75 Similarly, the population of Asiatic Lions has shown a steady increase, with a population \\nof 674 individuals (2020), 28.87 per cent (one of the highest growth rates so far) higher than the \\n523 lions in 2015. India now (2020) has 12,852 leopards compared to the previous estimate of 7910 conducted in 2014. More than a 60 per cent increase in population has been recorded. The current population estimates indicate about 50,000 – 60,000 Asian elephants worldwide. More than 60 per cent of the population is in India. Indian Elephant has also been listed in Appendix I of the Convention of the Migratory species in the Conference of Parties of CMS 13 at Gandhi Nagar, Gujarat, in February 2020.\\nFigure vii.13: Success story of tiger conservation \\nefforts reflected in increased tiger countFigure vii.14: rising lion count over the \\nyears, driven by various conservation efforts \\n 050010001500200025003000\\n2006 2010 2014 2018Number of tigers  \\n 0100200300400500600700\\n2005 2010 2015 2020Number of lions  \\nSource: National Tiger Conservation Authority Source: Press Information Bureau release\\n7.76 The Act has been amended multiple times to strengthen conservation measures and \\nfulfil multilateral commitments on wildlife preservation. Targeting further reforms in wildlife \\nconservation, the government has brought in the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2022. The Act seeks to increase the number of species protected under the law and implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora\\n16 (CITES). \\nThe Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 has six schedules. The Act aims to rationalise the schedules by (i) reducing the number of schedules for specially protected animals to two, (ii) removing the schedule for vermin species, and (iii) inserting a new schedule for specimens listed in the Appendices under CITES (scheduled specimens). Lastly, the Act empowers the government to regulate or prohibit the import, trade, possession or proliferation of invasive alien species.  \\nPlastic Waste management and elimination of identified Single-use Plastics7.77 India is committed to mitigating pollution caused by littered single-use plastics. According \\nto a report on Plastic Waste Management released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, \\nthe global average of plastic per capita consumption is 28 kg, and India has a per capita plastic consumption of 11 kg. However, as an attempt to reduce pollution caused due to littered plastic waste in the country, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, on August 12, 2021. On July 1, 2022, a ban was imposed on the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and \\n16\\u2002CITES is an international agreement between governments to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does \\nnot threaten the survival of the species. 240\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nuse of identified single-use plastic items, which have low utility and high littering potential, all \\nacross the country. The measures will promote a circular economy, reduce the plastic footprint of plastic packaging, promote the development of new alternatives to plastic packaging and provide the next steps for moving towards sustainable plastic packaging by businesses. \\n7.78 The following domestic regulatory actions were taken in 2022:\\ni.  The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notified the Guidelines on \\nExtended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging vide Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2022, on 16 February 2022.  The key highlights of the Guidelines on Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) on plastic packaging notified on February 16, 2022 are: \\n (a)  mandatory registration of Producers, Importers, and Brand Owners (PIBOs) and Plastic Waste Processors (PWPs) through a centralised online portal;\\n (b)  coverage of four categories of plastic packaging viz. rigid, flexible, multi-layered plastic packaging, and compostable plastic packaging; \\n (c) clearly defined targets for EPR; \\n (d)  mandatory targets for reuse of rigid plastic packaging, minimum level of recycling of plastic waste and use of recycled plastic content in plastic packaging; \\n (e) centralised online portal to support the implementation of EPR;\\n (f) provision for the sale and purchase of surplus EPR certificates;\\n (g) levy of environmental compensation for non-fulfilment of EPR obligations and \\n (h) provision for verification, audit and monitoring of obligated entities.\\nii.  The Plastic Waste Management (Second Amendment) Rules, 2022, were notified on July 6, 2022. The amendment aligns the rules with the Guidelines on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging. The amendment provides a statutory framework for biodegradable plastics after conforming to BIS Standards and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) certification. The rules mandate that environmental compensation shall be levied based upon the polluter pays principle, on persons not complying with the provisions of these rules, as per guidelines notified by the Central Pollution Control Board. \\n7.79 The waste management infrastructure in the States/UTs is also being strengthened through \\nthe Swachh Bharat Mission. All States/UTs have constituted a Special Task Force for eliminating single-use plastics and effectively implementing Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. A National Level Taskforce has been formed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to make coordinated efforts to eliminate identified single-use plastic items and effective implementation of Plastic Waste. \\n7.80 The resumed session of the fifth United Nations Environment Assembly held in Nairobi \\non 2 March 2022 adopted a resolution “End plastic pollution: towards an international legally 241\\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\\nbinding instrument”. India engaged constructively with all member states to develop a \\nconsensus on the resolution for driving global action on plastic pollution. On the insistence of India, the principle of national circumstances and capability\\n17 while addressing plastic pollution \\nwas included in the resolution text to allow developing countries to follow their development trajectories.\\nBattery Waste management\\n7.81 The Government published the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, on August 24, \\n2022 to ensure environmentally sound management of waste batteries. Notifying these rules is \\na transformative step towards promoting the circular economy. New rules will replace Batteries (Management and Handling) Rules, 2001. The rules cover all types of batteries, viz. Electric Vehicle batteries, portable batteries, automotive batteries, and industrial batteries. \\n7.82 The rules function based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), \\nwhere the producers (including importers) of batteries are responsible for the collection and \\nrecycling/refurbishment of waste batteries and the use of recovered materials from wastes into new batteries. EPR mandates that all waste batteries be collected and sent for recycling/refurbishment, prohibiting disposal in landfills and incineration. To meet the EPR obligations, producers may engage themselves or authorise any other entity to collect, recycle, or refurbish waste batteries.\\ne-waste management7.83 The Government notified the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, on November 2, 2022. \\nThese rules will replace the E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016, and will be effective from \\nApril 1, 2023. These rules will launch a new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regime for e-waste recycling. The salient feature of new rules is as under:\\n• Applicable to every manufacturer, producer, refurbisher, dismantler, and recycler who must \\nregister with CPCB. No entity shall carry out any business without registration and not deal with any unregistered entity.  \\n• The authorisation has now been replaced by registration through an online portal, and only manufacturers, producers, refurbishers and recyclers require registration.\\n• Schedule I has been expanded, and now 106 Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) have been included under the EPR regime.\\n• Producers of notified EEE have been given annual E-Waste Recycling targets based on the generation from the previously sold EEE or based on sales of EEE, as the case may be. \\n• Management of solar PV modules /panels/ cells added in new rules.\\n• The recycled quantity will be computed based on end-products to avoid false claims.  \\n• Provision for generation and transaction of EPR Certificate has been introduced. \\n• Provisions for environmental compensation and verification & audit have been introduced.\\n17\\u2002It was essential as not all countries are equally placed in terms of development and capabilities.242\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n7.84 Under these rules, a provision for reducing hazardous substances in the manufacturing \\nof EEE has been provided. It mandates that every producer of EEE and their components shall \\nensure that their products do not contain lead, mercury, and other hazardous substances beyond the maximum prescribed concentration.  It also provides for recognition and registration, skill development, monitoring, and ensuring the safety and health of workers involved in dismantling and recycling e-waste.\\nConclusion\\n7.85 India is spearheading one of the world’s most ambitious clean energy transitions and \\nremains steadfast in its commitment to combating climate change. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, India has enhanced its climate ambition manifold and embarked on a long-term strategy towards a Low GHG Emission Development Strategy by adopting a multi-pronged approach. \\n7.86 The energy transition plan is complemented by numerous policies intended to improve the \\necosystem to deploy promising technological innovations, like green hydrogen. The country has \\nconsistently modified/amended regulatory standards and adopted policy-level interventions to support the development and adoption of new technology. India’s progress on energy transition may be understood from the fact that it has enhanced its non-fossil fuel based installed capacity target to 50 per cent in its updated NDC as the target of 40 per cent of the first NDC was achieved well in advance.\\n7.87 The sustainable finance framework has also evolved from the initial steps covering the \\ntop listed 100 companies required to conform to sustainability standards. The requirement has \\nnow not only been extended to 1000 top listed companies on a mandatory basis but also the sustainability standards have become much stronger and measurable that correspond to the best practices while taking into account the specific context of India.   \\n7.88 As mentioned earlier, resources have competing use, and development strategies are not \\nsubstitutable. Modification in the development pathway has a transition cost, including social \\nand economic costs.  India’s climate ambitions require resources to be dedicated to the cause of climate change, in addition to, what is needed for the country’s development goals. Obligations on climate should be matched with the on-time availability of climate finance, technology, and inputs like critical minerals, while not jeopardising the socio-economic development objectives and aspirations. \\n7.89 Even if India has so far undertaken climate actions on its own, the heightened expectations \\nof further large-scale climate measures have to be equated with the enhanced initiatives by \\ndeveloped countries in terms of providing means of implementation, including finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building support. \\n7.90 More importantly, the global climate agenda will advance if advanced countries can set \\nexamples of policy and behavioural changes that work in their backyard and whose trade-offs \\nare well recognised and accepted by their people. Then, it might be realistic to expect such policies and behavioural expectations of households to succeed in developing countries with suitable adaptation.\\n******CHAPTER08\\nThe performance of the agriculture and allied sector has been buoyant over the past \\nseveral years, much of which is on account of the measures taken by the government to augment crop and livestock productivity, ensure certainty of returns to the farmers through price support, promote crop diversification, improve market infrastructure through the impetus provided for the setting up of farmer-producer organisations and promotion of investment in infrastructure facilities through the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The chapter discusses these aspects while also focussing on other government interventions to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanisation and boost horticulture and organic farming.  \\nThe chapter documents the performance of the animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries \\nsectors, which are increasingly recognised as emerging sectors by way of performance relative to the crop sector and their importance in the food basket and the farmers’ incomes. \\nThe legislation-backed nationwide food management programme, the National Food \\nSecurity Act (NFSA), is discussed.  To remove the financial burden of the poor, the Government has taken a decision to give free foodgrains to about 81.4 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA for one year from January 1, 2023\\nIntroduction\\n8.1 With its solid forward linkages, the agriculture and allied activities sector significantly \\ncontributed to the country\\'s overall growth and development by ensuring food security. The Indian agriculture sector has been growing at an average annual growth rate of 4.6 per cent during the last six years.  It grew by 3.0 per cent in 2021-22 compared to 3.3 per cent in 2020-21. In recent years, India has also rapidly emerged as the net exporter of agricultural products. In 2020-21, exports of agriculture and allied products from India grew by 18 per cent over the previous year.  During 2021-22, agricultural exports reached an all-time high of US$ 50.2 billion.  This period of buoyant performance could be ascribed to the measures taken by the Government to promote farmer-producer organisations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support provided for mechanisation and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. Thus, enabling the country, in the spirit of Vasudhaiva AgrIculture And Food  \\nMAnAgeMent: FroM  Food  \\nsecurIty to nutrItIonAl \\nsecurIty244\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nKutumbakam, to provide necessary and essential support to other countries for the losses faced \\nduring Covid-19. Further, income support to farmers through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the promotion of allied activities has led to diversification in sources of farmers’ income, improving their resilience to weather shocks.\\nFigure VIII.1: despite covid-19 shock agriculture and allied sector shows resilient growth\\n -0.2 0.6 6.8 6.6 \\n2.1 5.5 \\n3.3 3.0 \\n-2.00.02.04.06.08.0\\n2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 per cent  \\n Source: MoSPI’s Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at constant prices, 2011-12 series.\\n8.2 The interventions of the Government have been in line with the recommendations of the \\nCommittee on Doubling Farmers\\' Income, which had identified improvement in crop and livestock \\nproductivity, diversification towards higher value crops, better resource efficiency, enhanced cropping intensity, improvement in real prices received by farmers and shift from farm to non-farm occupations as being significant sources of growth. Several policy measures, such as the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to secure the price at one and half times the all-India weighted average cost of production, schemes and price measures to focus on high-value added crops such as oilseed, incentives for crop diversification through price policy measures, improvements in agricultural marketing and by enhancing resource use efficiency etc. have been adopted. While Indian agriculture has performed well, the sector needs re-orientation in the backdrop of certain challenges like adverse impacts of climate change, fragmented landholdings, sub-optimal farm mechanisation, low productivity, disguised unemployment, rising input costs, etc.\\nVarious policy initiatives introduced and implemented to deal with these issues are discussed \\nlater in this chapter.\\nFigure VIII.2: crowding in of Private investment in agriculture\\n 5.4 5.3 \\n4.7 4.8 4.6 4.9 4.7 4.9 \\n4.3 4.3 9.3 \\n8.0 9.6 \\n8.5 \\n6.9 7.5 \\n6.8 6.6 7.0 9.3 \\n0.02.04.06.08.010.012.0\\n2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 per cent  \\nPublic Private\\n Source: Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2021.245\\nAgriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security\\nFigure VIII.3: India’s electricity consumption in Agriculture (Annual)\\n 050100150200250\\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 GWh  Thousand  \\n Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation\\nrecord Production of Foodgrains \\n8.3 As per Fourth Advance Estimates for 2021-22, the production of food grains and oil seeds \\nhas been increasing Year-on-Year (YoY). Production of pulses has also been notably higher than \\nthe average of 23.8 million tonnes in the last five years. However, as indicated earlier changing climate has been impacting agriculture adversely. The year 2022 witnessed an early heat wave during the wheat-harvesting season, adversely affecting its production. The year experienced a decline in the sown area for paddy cultivation too in the Kharif season due to delayed monsoons and deficient rainfall. As per First Advance Estimates 2022-23 (kharif only) the paddy area was about 3.8 lakh hectares less than the sown area of 411.2 lakh hectare during 2021-22 (kharif season). Further, in the current rabi season the area under rabi paddy has expanded by 6.6 lakh hectares as compared to last year (Crop Weather Watch Group 12 January 2023).  As per the First Advance Estimates for 2022-23 (Kharif only), total food grains production in the country is estimated at 149.9 million tonnes which is higher than the average Kharif food grain production of the previous five years (2016-17 to 2020-21). Despite a fall in the sown area of Kharif paddy, the total production of Kharif rice during 2022-23 is estimated at 104.9 million tonnes, which is higher than the previous five years (2016-17 to 2020-21) average Kharif rice production of 100.5 million tonnes.\\nFigure VIII.4: sustained increase in Foodgrains Production in India (Million tonnes)\\n 252.0  251.5 275.1 285.0 285.2 297.5 310.7 315.7  \\n0.050.0100.0150.0200.0250.0300.0350.0\\n0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.040.0\\n2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22\\nTotal Foodgrains  \\nmillion tonnes  Pulses and oilseeds  \\nmillion tonnes   \\nOilseeds Pulses Total Fodgrains\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002 Source: 1st Advance Estimates (2022-23) of DA&FW released dated 21.09.2022.246\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nMsP to ensure returns over the cost of Production\\n8.4 The Union Budget for 2018-19 announced that farmers in India would be given an MSP \\nof at least one and a half times the cost of production.

Given nutritional requirements and changing dietary patterns and to achieve self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds production, the Government has fixed relatively higher MSP for pulses and oilseeds. \\nFigure VIII.5: Minimum Support Price for selected Kharif and Rabi Crops (₹/Quintal)\\n 0100020003000400050006000700080009000\\nPaddy (Common)\\nMaize\\nTur\\nMoong\\nUrad\\nGroundnut\\nSoyabean (yellow)\\nCotton (Long Staple)\\nWheat\\nGram\\nRapeseed & Mustard(₹/Quintal)  \\n2013-14 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23\\n Source: Based on data of DAFW and CACP.\\nenhanced Access to Agricultural credit\\n8.5 Ensuring hassle-free credit availability at a cheaper rate to farmers has been the top priority \\nof the Government of India. Accordingly, the Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) was introduced \\nin 1998 for farmers to empower them to purchase agricultural products and services on credit at any time. As of 30 December, 2022, banks issued Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to 3.89 crore eligible farmers with a KCC limit of ₹4,51,672 crore. With the Government of India extending the KCC facility to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers in 2018-19, the number of such cards in the fisheries and animal husbandry sector has also grown. As of 17 October 2022, 1.0 lakh KCCs have been sanctioned for the fisheries sector and 9.5 lakh (as of 4 November 2022) for the animal husbandry sector.\\n8.6 To ensure that the farmers pay a minimal interest rate to the banks, the Government of \\nIndia has introduced the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS), now renamed Modified Interest \\nSubvention Scheme (MISS), to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidised interest rates. Under this scheme, short-term agriculture loan up to ₹3 lakh is available at 7 per cent per annum to farmers engaged in Agriculture and other Allied activities, including Animal Husbandry, 247\\nAgriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security\\nDairying, Poultry, Fisheries etc. An additional 3 per cent subvention (Prompt Repayment \\nIncentive) is also given to the farmers for prompt and timely repayment of loans. Therefore, if a farmer repays his loan on time, he gets credit at 4 per cent per annum.\\n8.7 As a result of the initiatives taken and the measures to strengthen existing policies, there \\nhas been a consistent increase in the agriculture credit flow over the years, exceeding the target \\nevery year for the past several years. In 2021-22 also, it was about 13 per cent more than the target of ₹16.5 lakh crore. The target for the flow of credit to agriculture for 2022-23 has been fixed at ₹18.5 lakh crore.  \\nFigure VIII.6: Continued Increase in Institutional Credit to Agriculture Sector (₹ lakh crore)\\n 8.59.210.711.612.613.915.818.6\\n020406080100120140160180200\\n2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22(₹ lakh Crore)\\nSource: Based on data from DAFW and Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2021.\\nFarm mechanisation- Key to Improving Productivity\\n8.8 Farm mechanisation helps increase productivity through timely and efficient use of other \\ninputs and natural resources while at the same time reducing the cost of cultivation and the \\ndrudgery associated with various farm operations. Under the Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM), State Governments are being assisted in training and demonstrating agricultural machinery and helping farmers procure various farm machinery and equipment besides setting up Custom Hiring Centres (CHC). As of December 2022, 21628 CHCs and 467 Hi-Tech hubs and 18306 farm machinery banks have been established. Increasing fragmentation of farm holdings (with the average size of household ownership holdings declining from 1.23 ha in 2005-06 to 1.10 ha in 2010-11 and further to 1.08 ha in 2015-16) requires machines that are viable and efficient for small farm holdings \\n1. \\nchemical-free India: organic and natural Farming \\n8.9 Organic and natural farming provides chemical fertiliser and pesticide-free food grains \\nand other crops, improves soil health and reduces environmental pollution. India has 44.3 lakh organic farmers, the highest in the world, and about 59.1 lakh ha area was brought under organic farming by 2021-22. Sikkim voluntarily adopted going organic, and the process of getting the total cultivable land of 58,168 hectares under organic farming commenced at ground level in \\n1Agriculture Statistics at a glance 2021248\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n2010. It became the first State in the world to become fully organic, and other States, including \\nTripura and Uttarakhand, have set similar targets. \\n8. 10 The Government has been promoting organic farming by implementing two dedicated \\nschemes, i.e., Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain \\nDevelopment for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) since 2015 through cluster/ Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) formation. PKVY Scheme is being implemented in a cluster mode (with min. 20 ha size). Financial assistance of ₹50,000 per ha for three years is provided to the farmer, out of which ₹31,000 is given as incentives for organic inputs provided directly through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). Under PKVY as of 16 November 2022, 32,384 clusters totalling 6.4 lakh ha area and 16.1 lakh farmers have been covered. In addition, as part of the Namami Gange Programme, a 1.2 lakh ha area has been covered under organic farming. MOVCDNER is dedicated to promoting organic farming of niche crops of the North East Region through FPOs. Under the MOVCDNER, 177 FPOs/FPCs have been created, covering 1.5 lakh farmers and 1.7 lakh hectares.\\n8. 11 Promotion of natural farming began in 2019-20, when Bhartiya Prakratik Krishi Paddhati \\n(BPKP), a sub-scheme of PKVY , was launched to assist farmers in adopting traditional indigenous practices for encouraging all forms of ecological farming, including Zero-Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF). The scheme focuses on capacity building, training, handholding, and on-field demonstration of natural farming through champion farmers. Under the BPKP, 4.09 lakh ha of land have been brought under Natural farming in 8 States (Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu).\\nother Important Initiatives in Agriculture\\n8.12 PM KISAN Scheme: It is a Central Sector Scheme to supplement the financial needs of land-holding farmers. The financial benefit of  ₹6,000 per year is transferred into the bank accounts of farmer families through DBT. It is one of the largest DBT schemes in the world. About 11.3 crore farmers were covered under the Scheme in its April-July 2022-23 payment cycle. The Scheme, through a span of over 3 years, has successfully provided assistance of more than Rs. 2 lakh crore to crores of needy farmers. Many studies and findings indicate that the PM KISAN scheme has helped farmers towards productive investment in agricultural activities. This, through a multiplier effect, has contributed to the overall improvement of the farm sector. For instance, in an empirical\\n2 study  with the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), \\nthe International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) found that the scheme has enabled addressing the liquidity constraints of farmers for buying agricultural inputs. Further, for the small and marginal farmers, it has helped them meet their requirement of funds for farm inputs and their daily consumption, education, health and other incidental expenses. \\n8. 13 Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF): AIF is a financing facility operational from the year \\n2020-21 to 2032-33 for the creation of post-harvest management infrastructure and community \\nfarm assets, with benefits including 3 per cent interest subvention and credit guarantee support.

AIF scheme has the \\nfacility of convergence with any other scheme of the State or Central Government and can prove to be a milestone in investment in the agriculture sector.\\nSince its inception, an amount of ₹13,681 crore has been sanctioned for agriculture infrastructure \\nin the country, covering more than 18,133 projects. These include 8,076 warehouses, 2,788 primary processing units, 1,860 custom hiring centres, 937 sorting & grading units, 696 cold store projects, 163 assaying units and around 3613 other kinds of post-harvest management projects and community farming assets.\\n8.14 Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY): PMFBY is currently the largest crop \\ninsurance scheme in the world in terms of farmer enrolments, averaging 5.5 crore applications \\nevery year and the third largest in terms of the premium received. The scheme promises minimal financial burden on the farmer, with farmers paying only 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the total premium for the Rabi and Kharif seasons, respectively, with Centre and State Governments bearing most of the premium cost. During the last six years of its implementation, farmers paid a premium of ₹25,186 crore and received claims amounting to ₹1.2 lakh crore (as of 31 October 2022). The acceptability of the scheme amongst the farmer can be ascertained from the fact that the share of non-loanee, marginalised, and small farmers have increased by 282 per cent since the scheme’s inception in 2016.\\nBox VIII.1: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima yojana (PMFBy)\\n• PMFBY was launched in the 2016 Kharif season to provide comprehensive insurance \\ncoverage to farmers in case of crop failure, helping stabilise their incomes. The scheme is implemented through empanelled general insurance companies. It is modified/revamped on a timely basis considering the prevailing policy regime and requirement of policy intervention in crop insurance in the country. The Scheme covers all Food & Oilseeds crops and Annual Commercial/Horticultural Crops for which past yield data is available and for which the requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) are being conducted under the General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES). The revamped Scheme w.e.f Kharif 2020 has many features, which include voluntary participation for all farmers, selection of Insurance Companies by the States for 3 years in a go, a two-step process of crop yield estimation, use of smart sampling technique through satellite data for crop cutting experiments, etc.\\n• The scheme is implemented on an ‘Area Approach’ basis. Admissible claims are worked \\nout and paid directly to the insured farmer’s account by the insurance companies on the yield data based on the requisite number of CCEs per unit area furnished to the concerned insurance. However, losses due to localised risks of hailstorms, landslides, inundation, etc., are calculated on an individual-insured farm basis. These claims are assessed by a joint committee comprising representatives of the State Government and concerned insurance companies.250\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n• PMFBY is currently the largest crop insurance scheme in the world in terms of farmer \\nenrolments, averaging 5.5 crore applications every year and the third largest in terms of \\npremiums received. In the last six years of its implementation, farmers have paid a premium of ₹25,186 crore and received claims amounting to ₹1.26 lakh crore (as of 31st October 2022). The increase in acceptability of the scheme amongst the farmer can be ascertained from the fact that the share of non-loanee, marginalised and small farmers increased by 282 per cent since the scheme\\'s inception in 2016. During the arduous seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019 marred by weather extremities, the scheme proved to be a decisive factor in securing the livelihoods of farmers, wherein the claims paid ratio in several states averaged more than 100 per cent against the gross premium collected. For example, the States of Chhattisgarh (2017), Odisha (2017), Tamil Nadu (2018), and Jharkhand (2019) received 384 per cent, 222 per cent, 163 per cent and 159 per cent of claims ratio against a gross premium. \\n• To better resolve grievances within the scheme, National Crop Insurance Portal has been \\ndeveloped to handle all grievances from end to end. This portal is equipped with the necessary features, such as Complaint/Query capturing through multiple modes, farmer authentication & online ticket forwarding to the concerned company, online escalation as per escalation matrices, updating of resolution details, MIS & Dashboards for data analysis. It has API-based connectivity to the insurance companies and is well-designed, ensuring that every grievance is taken to a logical conclusion to the farmer\\'s satisfaction. Along with this, the redressal of complaints within the prescribed time limits is monitored through the portal by the concerned State and Central Government officials. The Beta version of the portal was launched in Chhattisgarh on 21st July 2022. \\n• Further, a provision of Stratified Grievance Redressal Mechanism, viz. District Level \\nGrievance Redressal Committee (DGRC), State Level Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC) has been made in the Revised Operational Guidelines of the Scheme to resolve such complaints.\\n8.15 Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH): Several expert groups have \\nidentified horticulture as a high-growth area and a source of buoyant income and improved resilience for farmers. The scheme to promote horticulture covering fruits, vegetables, root and tuber crops, spices, flowers, plantation crops etc., was introduced in 2014-15. The interventions include introducing improved varieties and quality seeds, incentives for plantation crops, cluster development, and post-harvest management. According to third advance estimates (2021-22), a record production of 342.3 million tonnes in an area of 28.0 million hectares was achieved. The government has identified 55 horticulture clusters, of which 12 have been selected for the Cluster Development Programme (CDP) pilot phase. This programme is designed to leverage the geographical specialisation of horticulture clusters and promote integrated and market-led development of pre-production, production and post-harvest activities, including the entire supply chain.\\n8.16 National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) Scheme: The Government of India launched \\nthe National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) Scheme in 2016 to create an online transparent, \\ncompetitive bidding system to ensure farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. Under 251\\nAgriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security\\nthe e-NAM Scheme, the Government provides free software and assistance of ₹75 lakh per \\nAPMC mandi for related hardware, including quality assaying equipment and the creation of infrastructure like cleaning, grading, sorting, packaging, compost unit, etc. As on 31 December 2022, more than 1.7 crore farmers and 2.3 lakh traders have been registered on e-NAM portal\\n8.17 Climate-Smart Farming Practices: This is slowly gaining acceptance with farmers using \\nclean energy sources like solar for irrigation. The farmers have been incentivised to transfer \\nelectricity generated through solar to the local grid. Crop yield prediction models using artificial intelligence and drones for monitoring soil and crop health have been initiated. Smart farming also enables crop diversification, which will help farmers reduce their dependence on monsoons for water. There are over 1,000 agritech start-ups in India. These assist farmers in improving farming techniques \\n3.  \\nBox VIII.2: International year of the Millets: our traditional staple and a \\nhealthier alternative\\n3www.investindia.gov.in/team-india -blogs/digitalization-agriculture-indiaSource: Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare\\nThe United Nations General Assembly, in its 75th session during March 2021, declared 2023 the International Year of Millets (IYM). Millets are Smart Food with high nutritional value, are climate resilient, and align with several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   These are also important by virtue of their mammoth potential to generate livelihood, increase farmers’ income and ensure food & nutritional security all over the world.252\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nIndia produces more than 50.9 million tonnes (as per fourth advance estimate) of millet which \\naccounts for 80 per cent of Asia’s and 20 per cent of global production. The global average yield is 1229 kg/ha, whereas India has a higher average yield of 1239 kg/ha. In India, millets are primarily a Kharif crop mostly grown in rainfed conditions, requiring less water and agricultural inputs than other staple crops. \\nGiven the nutritional value of the millets, the Government notified Millets as Nutri-cereals in \\nApril 2018. Under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), millets have been introduced to provide nutritional support. A sub-mission on Nutri-cereals is being implemented since 2018-19 in 212 districts of 14 States.\\nIndia has more than 500 start-ups working in the millet value chains, while the Indian \\nInstitute of Millets Research has incubated 250 start-ups under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana – Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR).\\nAllied sectors: Animal Husbandry, dairying and Fisheries catching up in \\nrecent y ears\\n8.18 The allied sectors of Indian agriculture - livestock, forestry & logging and fishing & \\naquaculture are gradually becoming sectors of buoyant growth and a potential source of better \\nfarm incomes. The livestock sector grew at a CAGR of 7.9 per cent during 2014-15 to 2020-21 (at constant prices), and its contribution to total agriculture GV A (at constant prices) has increased from 24.3 per cent in 2014-15 to 30.1 per cent in 2020-21. Similarly, the annual average growth rate of the fisheries sector has been about 7 per cent since 2016-17 and has a share of about 6.7 per cent in total agriculture GV A. Higher growth in allied sectors compared to the crop sector has obvious implications in terms of the increasing importance of the former in total agricultural GV A. Recognising the growing importance of allied sectors, the Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI, 2018) considers dairying, livestock, poultry, fisheries and horticulture as high-growth engines and has recommended a focussed policy with a concomitant support system for the allied sector. \\nFigure VIII.7: though the crop sector is still the major contributor to agriculture gV A, the \\nlivestock sector is catching up (per cent) \\n \\n 65.4  64.5 64.4 62.2 60.0 59.1 58.4  55.9 55.8 55.1 \\n0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.0GVA of Crop and Allied Sectors  \\nLivestock Forestry & logging Fishing and aquaculture Crops\\n \\n Source: Based on data of MoSPI.253\\nAgriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security\\n8.19 The dairy sector is the most critical component of the livestock sector, employing more \\nthan eight crore farmers directly, and is the most prominent agrarian product. Other livestock \\nproducts, such as eggs and meat, are also growing in importance. While India ranks first in milk production in the world, it ranks third in egg production and eighth in meat production in the world. \\n8.20 Cognisant of the importance of allied sectors, the Government has made several critical \\ninterventions to enhance infrastructure and improve livestock productivity and disease control. \\nAs a part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (ANB) stimulus package, the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) worth ₹15,000 crore was launched in 2020. Under this scheme, the Central Government provides a 3 per cent interest subvention to the borrower and credit guarantees up to 25 per cent of total borrowing. As of 14 October 2022, 116 projects have been approved under the scheme involving project costs of ₹3,731.4 crore. National Livestock Mission (NLM) scheme has been restructured for 2021-22 to 2025-26. The scheme focuses on entrepreneurship development and breeds improvement in poultry, sheep, goat and piggery, including feed and fodder development. Also, the Livestock Health and Disease Control (LH&DC) Scheme is being implemented to supplement the State/UT governments’ efforts towards preventing, controlling and containing animal diseases of economic and zoonotic importance by vaccination. National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) is being implemented to control Foot & Mouth Disease and Brucellosis by completely vaccinating cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pig populations against Foot & Mouth Disease and bovine female calves of 4-8 months of age against brucellosis.\\n8.21 In May 2020, as a part of the ANB package, the Government of India launched its flagship \\nscheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), with a total outlay of ₹20,050 crore. \\nPMMSY marks the highest-ever investment in the fisheries sector in India, to be implemented over five years from FY21 to FY25 in all States/Union Territories to drive sustainable and responsible development of the fisheries sector while ensuring socio-economic development of the fishers, fish farmers and fish workers. Before this, attention had been paid to addressing infrastructure gaps in the fisheries sector. A dedicated Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) was established for five years, from 2018-19 to 2022-23, with an investment of ₹7,522 crore. Under the FIDF, as of 17 October 2022, proposals to the tune of ₹4,923.9 crore have been approved and have benefitted over 9.4 lakh persons, through direct and indirect employment, in fishing and allied activities.\\nsahakar-se-samriddhi: From cooperation to Prosperity\\n8.22 The cooperative societies, especially in the agriculture, dairy and fisheries sectors, provide \\nthe rural population with livelihood opportunities and a financial safety net with a community-based approach. Cooperatives hold the key to rural economic transformation.  There are 8.5 lakh registered cooperatives in the country, having more than 29 crore members mainly from the marginalised and lower-income groups in the rural areas, and 98 per cent of villages are covered by Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS). \\n8.23 To realise the vision of “Sahakar-see-Samriddhi”, a renewed impetus was given to the \\ngrowth of the cooperative sector. Currently, around 19 per cent of agriculture finance is through 254\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\ncooperative societies. A full-fledged Ministry of Cooperation was established in July 2021 to \\nprovide greater focus to the cooperative sector. In addition, the Government has taken various initiatives to promote and strengthen PACS, like the computerisation of 63,000 functional PACS and the preparation of by-laws for enabling PACS to expand their activities. \\n8.24 The Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002 (MSCS) was enacted after repealing \\nthe Multi-State Cooperative Act 1984, to facilitate the democratic functioning and autonomous \\nworking of Multi-State Cooperative Societies in line with the established Cooperative Principles. As of date, there are 1528 registered societies under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act 2002. The MSCSs include 66 Multi-State Cooperative Banks with deposits of approx. ₹2.6 lakh crore. Maharashtra leads 661 cooperatives, followed by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.\\nFigure VIII.8: top ten states with Multi-state cooperative societies as on 20 october 2022\\n 661 \\n159 156 126 72 69 42 29 29 28 \\n0100200300400500600700\\nMAHARASHTRA\\nDELHI\\nUTTAR PRADESH\\nTAMIL NADU\\nRAJASTHAN\\nWEST BENGAL\\nGUJARAT\\nKARNATAKA\\nMADHYA PRADESH\\nKERALANo. of Societies  \\nBox VIII.3:   new national cooperation Policy\\nWith the view to strengthening the cooperative movement in the country, deepening its reach \\nto the grassroots, and promoting cooperative-based economic development, a New National Cooperation Policy is being formulated involving the relevant stakeholders such as experts of the cooperative sector, representatives from National/ State/ District/ Primary level cooperative societies, Secretaries (Cooperation) and Resident Commissioners from States/UTs, officers from Central Ministries/ Departments. The objective is to have a policy that unlocks the true potential of the Cooperation sector. \\nIn addition, the Government has also decided to introduce the Multi-State Co-operative \\nSocieties (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The Bill seeks to amend the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002, to bring it in line with Part IXB of the Constitution and to strengthen the cooperative movement in the country by bringing in provisions relating to electoral reforms, strengthening governance and transparency, reforming the composition, meetings and membership of board; enabling the raising of funds by co-operative sector, strengthening monitoring mechanism, enhancing ‘Ease of doing business’, etc. The bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 7 December 2022 in the winter session of Parliament.255\\nAgriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security\\nFood Processing sector-the sunrise sector\\n8.25 The food processing sector is of enormous significance for India\\'s development because \\nof the strong connections and interactions it promotes between industry and agriculture. During \\nthe last five years ending FY21, the food processing industries sector has been growing at an average annual growth rate of around 8.3 per cent. As per the latest Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) 2019-20, 12.2 per cent of persons in the registered manufacturing sector were employed in the food processing sector. The value of agri-food exports, including processed food exports, was about 10.9 per cent of India\\'s total exports during 2021-22.\\n8.26 With the growing importance of processed food items in the consumer basket, new \\nhorizons are now open for both the agriculture and the industry sector pushing diversification \\nand commercialisation in farming, improvement in the efficiency of resource use, enhancement in the income of farmers, expansion in the avenues to export agro foods and generation of employment opportunities. Optimum development of the food processing sector will contribute significantly to tackling several developmental concerns such as disguised rural unemployment in agriculture, rural poverty, food security, food inflation, improved nutrition, prevention of wastage of food etc. \\n8.27 To facilitate the unfettered growth of the food processing sector, there is a continuous \\nneed for extensive investment in cold chain infrastructure and address logistical challenges. \\nThe NITI Aayog Strategy for New India identifies the lack of adequate and efficient cold chain infrastructure as a critical supply-side bottleneck that leads to massive post-harvest losses (mostly of perishables) estimated at ₹92,561 crore annually\\n4 . The uneven geographic \\ndistribution of cold storage infrastructure also contributes to regional-level disparities. Given that countries worldwide have stringent guidelines for importing food and agricultural products, the probability of exports from India getting rejected increases with the lack of adequate cold chain infrastructure. Further, logistical barriers relating to connectivity also pose supply-side challenges. For instance, Indian national highways, while accounting for 2 per cent of the total road network, carry 40 per cent of all cargo – exemplifying the burden on the existing road networks and potential for congestion, which is detrimental to food (and particularly perishables) transport. \\n8.28 Recognising the abundant potential of the sector, the Government has been at the forefront \\nwith various interventions aimed at the development of food processing in the country. The \\nMinistry of Food Processing Industries, through the component schemes of Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY), provide financial assistance for the overall growth and development of the food processing sector. Under PMKSY , 677 projects have been completed till 31 December 2022. The Ministry also launched in 2020 the Prime Minister\\'s Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME) Scheme as part of the ANB Abhiyan to enhance the competitiveness of individual micro-enterprises in the unorganised segment and promote the formalisation of this sector by providing financial, technical and business support for upgradation/setting up of 2 lakh micro units in the country. As of 31 December 2022, 15,095 loans of ₹1402.6 crore were sanctioned. The scheme adopts the One District One Product \\n4Niti Aayog, New Strategy for India @75 , Dec 2018, chapter 7, page 36.256\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n(ODOP) approach to reap the benefit of scale in procuring inputs, using shared services and \\nmarketing products. So far, 713 Districts with 137 unique products were approved under the ODOP in 35 States/ UTs. \\n8.29 The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industry (PLISFPI), \\nlaunched in March 2022, has the specific mandate to incentivise investments to create global \\nfood champions. Sectors with high growth potential, like marine products, processed fruits & vegetables, and ‘Ready to Eat/ Ready to Cook’ products, are covered for support. In phase -I, 149 applications have been selected for assistance under the PLISFPI. Subsequently, a PLI Scheme for millet-based products was also introduced with an outlay of ₹800 crore. In phase-II, 33 applications (both organic and millet products) have been selected.\\n8.30 To focus on transporting perishable food products, including horticulture, fishery, livestock \\nand processed products, from the Hilly Areas, North-Eastern States and Tribal Areas, Krishi \\nUDAN 2.0 version was launched in October 2021 as a six-month pilot project. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) provides a full waiver of Landing, Parking, Terminal Navigational Landing Charges (TNLC) and Route Navigation Facility Charges (RNFC) for Indian freighters and P2C (Passenger-to-Cargo) aircraft. The scheme covers around 25 airports focusing on North Eastern, Hilly and Tribal regions and 28 airports in other regions/areas. Thus, the scheme assists farmers in transporting agricultural products and improves value realisation. \\nFood security- social & legal commitment to the People of the nation\\n8.31 Food security is not only a question of the ability to produce food but also of the ability \\nto access food. The Government is currently running the most extensive legislation-based food security programme in the world, covering about 80 crore of India\\'s population under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. The food management programme in India comprises procurement of food grains from farmers at remunerative prices, distribution of food grains to consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of society, at affordable prices and maintenance of food buffer stock for food security and price stability. Till December 2022, the NFSA provided, for coverage of up to 75 per cent of the rural and up to 50 per cent of the urban population highly subsidised food grains at ₹1/2/3 per kg for coarse grains/wheat/rice, respectively, at the rate of 35 kg per family per month to households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and at the rate of 5 kg per person per month to priority households. In a recent decision, the government has decided to provide free foodgrains to about 81.35 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA for one year from January 1, 2023. To remove the financial burden of the poor, the government will spend more than ₹2 lakh crore in this period on food subsidies under NFSA and other welfare schemes. Under this, the Government will provide 5 kg of foodgrains per person to Priority Households (PHH) beneficiaries and 35 kg per household to Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) beneficiaries (poorest of the poor) free of cost for the next year. \\n8.32 Procurement from farmers for this programme is at MSP. During Kharif Marketing Season \\n(KMS) 2021-22, 581.7 lakh metric tons (LMT) of Rice was procured against an estimated target \\nof 532.7 LMT. In the current year, KMS 2022-23, a total of 355 LMT of rice has been procured up to 31 December 2022. Also, during Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2022-23, 187.9 LMT 257\\nAgriculture and Food Management: From Food Security to Nutritional Security\\nwheat was procured against 433.4 LMT procured during RMS 2021-22. The procurement was \\nlower as the market price of wheat was higher than its MSP during its procurement season. During 2022-23, the Government of India allocated 970.1 lakh tons of foodgrains to States/UTs under NFSA and Other Welfare Schemes, etc.\\nFigure VIII.9: Allocation of Foodgrains under nFsA and other Welfare schemes in 2022-23 and  \\nas of 1 January 2023 (lMt)\\n 600.22\\n358.83\\n5.53 5.55\\n0100200300400500600700\\nNFSA (including ICDS &\\nPM-POSHAN )PM GKAY Allocations\\n(VI & VII Phase)Covid Allocation (Non\\nNFSA, OMSS Cost)Other Welfare\\nMeasures +Additional\\nof Allocation at\\nEconomic Costlakh ton\\nSource: Department of Food and Public Distribution.\\n8.33 To ease the hardships faced by the poor due to economic disruption caused by Covid-19, \\nthe Government initially launched Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) for \\nthe period from April to June 2020. However, keeping in view the need for continuous support to the poor and the needy, the scheme has been extended and implemented in various phases (Phase VII is the latest covering October-December,2022). Under the scheme, 5 kg of additional food grains per person per month has been/is being provided free of cost to NFSA beneficiaries in all the phases. Under the PM-GKAY scheme ( covering all phases), the Government has allocated about 1,118 LMT foodgrains to the States/UTs.\\n8.34 To further ease the process of access to food, the Government launched a citizen-centric \\nand technology-driven scheme in 2019 called the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) \\nscheme. The ONORC system enables intra-State and inter-State portability of ration cards. It helps the migrant beneficiaries access their food security entitlements from any fair price shop (FPS) of their choice by using the same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (e-PoS) devices at the FPS. Presently, the national/inter-State portability is enabled in all 36 States/UT, covering 100 per cent of the total NFSA population.\\n8.35 The food subsidy bill was higher during 2020-21 and 2021-22 in comparison to other years \\nas a result of the free food distribution programme of the government under the PMGKAY . This \\ndedicated support was provided to ensure that the farmers and vulnerable households remained protected from the Covid-19 led shocks.258\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure VIII.10: total Food subsidy released by the government of India since 2014-15.  \\n(In ₹ thousand crore)\\n 113.2 134.9 130.7 140.0  171.1 164.1 529.7 \\n288.7 \\n0.0100.0200.0300.0400.0500.0600.0\\n2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22(₹ thousand crore)  \\nSource: Based on data received from DFPD\\nNote: i.

Investment in the sector must be encouraged through an affordable, timely \\nand inclusive approach to credit delivery. Intervention by the Government through PM Kisan to provide income support, strengthening of institutional finance and insurance through the PMFBY and the push given to Kisan Credit Cards as also access to machines and tools that improve productivity have been significant. A focus on the horticulture sector and the thrust towards allied activities have diversified farmers’ income making them more resilient to weather shocks. All these initiatives have led to sustainable and inclusive development of the sector.\\n8.37 A greater focus on the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastage/\\nloss and increase the length of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers. The initiatives \\nlike e-NAM and the Promotion of FPOs formation have been introduced to strengthen the agricultural market. With the interventions including PMKSY , PMFME, PLI, etc., attempts have been made to boost the food processing industries to harness its linkages with the agriculture sector. A well-developed food processing sector with improved infrastructure like cold storage and better logistics helps reduce wastage, improve value addition, ensure better farmers\\' returns, promote employment, and increase export earnings. CHAPTER09\\nThe industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy contributing about 30 \\npercent of total gross value added in the country. In FY23, the Indian industry faced \\nsome extraordinary challenges as the Russian-Ukraine conflict broke out. That led to a \\nsharp rise in the prices of many commodities. Prices of edible oil, crude oil, fertilisers and food grains rose sharply. They remained at elevated levels for several months. The \\nrisk of another round of supply chain disruptions emerged, but they were not as severe \\nas feared. Nonetheless, both the price and the availability of essential commodities had the potential to dent the industry’ s optimism on consolidating the recovery of FY22 and \\nfurther accelerating it. It is fair to say that the Indian industry acquitted itself rather well \\nunder trying circumstances. Overall Gross Value Added (GVA) by the Industrial Sector, based on data available for the first half of the FY23, rose 3.7 per cent, which is higher \\nthan the average growth of 2.8 per cent achieved in H1 of the last decade. \\nRobust domestic conditions since FY22 have provided a demand stimulus to industrial \\ngrowth. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 \\nwas the highest among all half years, H1 or H2, since FY15. Further, the strong export \\nperformance of FY22 continued somewhat in the first half of FY23. In this half of the year, exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16. \\nHowever, the performance began to wane in the first half itself as the Year-on-Year (YoY) \\ngrowth of exports declined from Q1 to Q2 due to persistently high inflation and rising interest rates in the advanced economies. The increase in investment demand has emerged \\nas another powerful stimulus to industrial growth. It has been triggered by the augmented \\ncapex of the central government in the current and the previous year as compared to the pre-pandemic years. The leap also has crowded in private investment, already upbeat on \\nthe pent-up demand, export stimulus, and strengthening of the corporate balance sheets.\\nThe supply response of the industry to the demand stimulus has been robust, as seen in \\nhigh-frequency indicators. PMI manufacturing has remained in the expansion zone for \\n18 months since July 2021, and its sub-indices indicate an easing of input cost pressures, \\nimproving supplier delivery times, robust export orders, and future output. While growth in the consumer durables component of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is on \\naccount of the release of ‘pent-up’ demand, the increase in capital goods and infrastructure/\\nconstruction goods is indicative of the beginnings of a virtuous investment cycle that is expected to be led by the private sector. The growth of the eight core industries of coal, \\nfertilisers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products has held steady, reflecting a \\nbroad momentum in industrial activity. However, the manufacturing landscape further shows uneven growth across various categories, with industries such as automobiles and INDUSTRY: STeaDY  \\nRecoveRY260\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nelectronics registering impressive performances while sectors such as textiles have been \\nshowing tepid growth, as export demand for these products has been mellowing with the \\nslowing of global output and demand. \\nIndustrial activity has been supported by an upswing in bank credit to the sector. Credit \\nto industry started recovering from the beginning of the year and has been growing in \\ndouble digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase in \\npart, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in credit \\ndemanded by MSMEs, large industries have begun to increase the pace of their credit \\nofftake too since the beginning of FY23 as they look to reduce their pace of capital raising from volatile debt and equity markets. The robust growth in credit demand combined \\nwith rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses’ \\noptimism regarding future demand. \\nAmidst heightened global uncertainty, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the \\nmanufacturing sector moderated in the first half of FY23. However, inflows stayed well \\nabove the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the \\nworld.\\nThe electronics industry continues to ascend in importance as its applications become \\npervasive. Electronics, supported by continuously improving communication services, will \\nsignificantly enhance productivity, efficient service delivery, and social transformation. \\nThis industry’ s significant growth drivers are mobile phones, consumer electronics, and industrial electronics. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largest \\nmobile phone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from 6 \\ncrore units in FY15 to 29 crore units in FY21. \\nThe Indian Pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals \\nindustry. India is ranked 3rd worldwide in the production of pharma products by volume \\nand 14th by value. The sector is the largest provider of generic medicines globally, occupying a 20 per cent share in global supply by volume, and is also the leading vaccine \\nmanufacturer globally with a market share of 60 per cent. The performance of pharma \\nexports has been robust, sustaining positive growth despite the global trade disruptions and drop in demand for Covid-19-related treatments. The cumulative FDI in the pharma \\nsector crossed the US$ 20 billion mark by September 2022.\\nThe pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have demonstrated the risk of supply chain \\nshocks to the global economic order. As companies adapt their manufacturing and supply \\nchain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global \\nmanufacturing hub this decade. In this context, the government’ s Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation and built world-class infrastructure while \\naddressing the gaps in domestic manufacturing capabilities. The Production Linked \\nIncentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories has further complemented it with an estimated Capex of around ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to \\ngenerate over 60 lakh jobs. In the medium term, the scheme will help reduce net imports \\nby building domestic manufacturing capacity that will cater to domestic and global needs.261\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nIntroduction\\n9.1 Industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy, accounting for 31 per cent of \\nGDP, on average, during FY12 and FY21 and employing over 12.1 crore people. The sector’s \\nrelevance can be identified through various direct and indirect linkages with other sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. First, it ensures that domestic production can accommodate domestic demand and reduces the reliance on imports. Thereby assisting in the improvement of trade and current account balances. Second, industrial growth has multiplier effects, which translates into employment growth. Some industries, such as textiles and construction, have high employment elasticities. Third, industrial growth spurs growth in services sectors such as banking, insurance, logistics, etc.\\nTable IX.1: Growth and Share of Industrial components (in Per cent)\\nGrowth in Per cent Real Gv a \\ngrowth in \\nFY23 over \\nFY22Real Gv a \\ngrowth in \\nFY23 over \\nFY20Share in total \\nGv a  FY23H1:FY23H2:FY23 \\n(estimated)\\nIndustry 3.7 4.5 4.1 11.1 30.0\\n\\u2003Mining & quarrying 2.2 2.6 2.4 4.4 2.3\\n\\u2003Manufacturing 0.1 3.0 1.6 11.0 17.3\\n\\u2003 Electricity, gas, water \\nsupply & other utility services10.0 7.9 9.0 13.0 2.3\\n\\u2003Construction 11.5 7.3 9.1 12.8 8.1\\noverall Gv a 9.0 4.7 6.7 9.8 -\\nSource: National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)Note: Data for FY23 presents the First Advance Estimates\\n9.2 Industrial production is a means to increase industrial income in the country. As measured \\nby industrial GV A, growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GV A growth in the \\neconomy since the pre-pandemic year of FY20. Manufacturing GV A, which contributes more than 50 per cent of industrial GV A, has grown at an even higher rate when compared to overall GV A. In FY23, the Industry sector witnessed modest growth of 4.1 per cent compared to the strong growth of 10.3 per cent in FY22. This is likely on account of input cost-push pressures, supply chain disruptions and the China lockdown impacting the availability of essential inputs and slowing the global economy. The fading away of the base effect must have also weighed on growth in FY23. On a positive note, estimates of H2:FY23 shows improvement in overall industrial growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, both yearly and sequentially. Easing input prices and conducive demand conditions will support growth, ceteris paribus.\\n9.3 In this chapter, the survey will review the performance of the Indian industry in the current \\nfinancial year. It explores the demand stimulants to industrial growth, the supply response of the \\nindustry, trends in credit to the industry and foreign investment in India’s industrial sector. The chapter also addresses the developments in key sub-industries and their challenges. Towards the end, it evaluates India’s aspirations and prospects of becoming a key player in global value chains.262\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nDemand Stimulus to Industrial Growth\\n9.4 FY23 began with the month-old Russian-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of relenting. \\nAs the year draws to a close, the conflict appears to have plateaued, although global commodity \\nprices are yet to deescalate to their pre-pandemic levels. Industry, throughout the year, has \\nthus faced high input costs imported into the country. Fearing demand impact, the industry has been gradually passing on the higher production costs, which has led to sticky but non-rising \\ncore retail inflation. Non-core retail inflation, on the other hand, comprising food and energy \\ncomponents, has been declining as local weather extremities have eased and interventions by the government to restrict price rises have proven effective. The consequent decrease in overall \\nretail inflation has thus sustained the pent-up consumer demand in the post-pandemic Indian \\neconomy, inducing an industrial recovery despite the global headwinds. With world commodity prices now also on a downward trajectory and showing up in declining rates of India’s wholesale \\ninflation, core retail inflation is expected to relent, making domestic consumption demand much \\nstronger to further induce industrial growth in the country. PFCE as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15.\\n9.5 Strong external demand also served the Indian industry well in FY22 when manufactured \\nexports soared, responding to a rebound in global growth. Trade had also recovered and grown as \\nbottlenecks in global supply chains eased. The export stimulus for the Indian economy persisted \\nin the first half of FY23. In this half of the year, exports of goods and services as a share of \\nGDP have been the highest since FY16. However, the export impulse has been waning in the first half itself as the YoY growth of exports has declined from Q1 to Q2 due to persistently \\nhigh inflation and rising interest rates in the advanced economies. Export growth may slow \\nfurther in the second half of the current financial year and remain weak beyond that, too, if the global economy falls into recession. However, the strong domestic consumption growth and \\ninvestment revival is expected to keep industrial production humming.\\n9.6 Indeed, an increase in investment demand has emerged as another powerful stimulus to \\nindustrial growth. It has been triggered by a jump in the Capex of the central government in \\nthe current and the previous year as compared to the pre-pandemic years. The leap also has \\ncrowded-in private investment, already upbeat on the pent-up consumption demand, export \\nstimulus, and strengthening of the corporate balance sheets. Capacity utilisation at 74.3 per \\ncent in Q1 of FY23 has already reached the tipping point of 75.3 per cent in Q4 of FY22, at \\nwhich investments in building new capacities are undertaken. New Investment announced in the manufacturing sector during April-December of FY23 was five times the corresponding level in \\nFY20. The surge in investment is also attributable to the policy actions taken by the Government \\nover the past several years. A beginning has been made in H1 of FY23, which recorded the highest share of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in GDP among all half-years since \\nFY15.263\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nFigure IX.1: Private Investment gathers momentum\\n 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40PharmaCementTextilesAutoChemicalsCapital goodsMiningConstructionElectricitySteel\\n₹ Lakh CroreH1 FY23\\nH1 FY22\\nSource: Axis Bank Research, Capitaline\\nBox IX.1: Unfolding of Private capital Investment cycle\\nA view is fast emerging that the private sector is predisposed to increasing investment in the third \\ndecade of the new millennium. This has roots in the first decade of the new millennium when a credit \\nboom financed rising levels of investment rates. Consequently, by the time the second decade began, \\nthe balance sheets of both the corporates and banks became stressed. As a result, corporates switched focus from investment to deleveraging while banks slowed credit disbursement in view of high Non-\\nPerforming Assets (NPAs). Consequently, the investment rate declined, and the economy began to \\nslow. Midway into the second decade, the problems were identified, and mitigation measures were \\ninitiated. For the banks, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was instituted to resolve their \\nstressed assets while the equity base of public sector banks was strengthened. For the corporates, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout improved their ease of doing business while the corporate tax \\nrate was slashed to increase their profits/ investible reserves for financing investment. During the \\npandemic, the implementation of ECLGS lent additional support to the MSMEs. Maturing digital infrastructure and easy and cheap data access have further enriched the investment climate.\\nFigure a: Deleveraging by private non-financial sector \\n 406080100120\\nJun-05\\nJun-06\\nJun-07\\nJun-08\\nJun-09\\nJun-10\\nJun-11\\nJun-12Jun-13\\nJun-14\\nJun-15\\nJun-16\\nJun-17\\nJun-18\\nJun-19\\nJun-20\\nJun-21\\nJun-22Per cent of GDPCore debt of private non-financial sector\\nSource: Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\\nNote: Credit to the non-financial sector captures the borrowing activity of the private non-financial sector .264\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nDeleveraging has strengthened the corporate balance sheets, as evident in the declining core debt of \\nthe private non-financial sector. Credit to the private non-financial sector as a percentage of GDP \\nin India had come down from a peak of 113.0 per cent in December 2010 to a low of 83.8 per cent \\nin December 2018. This shows that de-leveraging was completed by the end of 2018. With the \\nelections out of the way in May 2019 and with corporate tax cuts announced in September 2019, \\nit would have resulted in an improvement in investment and economic growth cycles, but it was \\ndelayed due to the disruption caused by the pandemic for two years. Deleveraging resumed from the \\nbeginning of FY22 as core debt of the private non-financial sector decreased to 87.8 per cent of GDP \\nin the June 2022 quarter from 100.7 per cent in the March 2021 quarter on the back of improved \\ncorporate performance and a recovery in GDP levels. \\nDuring H1:FY23, the interest coverage ratio was 5, higher than its five-year (FY20) average of 3. \\nThe debt-equity ratio also declined from 0.8 to 0.4. These improvements have further absorbed the \\nincrease in working capital requirements triggered by volatility in global commodity prices and \\nsupply chain disruptions. On the other hand, profit margins peaked in the second half of FY21 as \\nlow inflation kept input costs from rising while restricted mobility reduced overheads. Subsequently, \\nprofit margins started to decline as input costs rose on the back of rising global commodity prices. \\nWith global commodity prices declining, input costs are set to fall, and profit margins are expected \\nto increase. Expected increases in profits and strengthened balance sheets have made the corporate sector financially stronger and optimistic about increasing net sales. The Reserve Bank of India’s \\n(RBI) Industrial Outlook Survey conducted during July-September 2022 points towards optimism \\nabout production, order books, employment, and profit margins for the period covered until Q1 of \\nFY24.\\nFigure B: Net Sales expected to rise Figure c: Profit Margins Improving\\n-40-20020406080\\nH2:FY18\\nH1:FY19\\nH2:FY19\\nH1:FY20H2:FY20H1:FY21H2:FY21H1:FY22\\nH2:FY22\\nH1:FY23Per cent, YoY\\n-80-4004080\\n-12-7-238\\nH2:FY18\\nH1:FY19H2:FY19\\nH1:FY20\\nH2:FY20H1:FY21H2:FY21\\nH1:FY22\\nH2:FY22H1:FY23\\nPer cent, YoYPer cent, YoYNet ProfIt Margins\\nOperating Expenses (RHS)265\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nFigure D: Liquidity and Gearing Ratios \\nmarginally healthierFigure e: capacity Utilisation and Business \\nexpectation\\n00.10.20.30.40.50.6\\n0246810\\nH2:FY18\\nH1:FY19\\nH2:FY19\\nH1:FY20\\nH2:FY20\\nH1:FY21H2:FY21\\nH1:FY22\\nH2:FY22\\nH1:FY23\\nRatioRatioInterest Cover Debt-Equity Ratio (RHS)\\n 6080100120140160\\n4050607080\\nQ1:FY19\\nQ3:FY19\\nQ1:FY20\\nQ3:FY20Q1:FY21Q3:FY21Q1:FY22Q3:FY22\\nQ1:FY23\\nQ3:FY23\\nIndexPer centCapacity Utilisation BEI (RHS)\\nSource: Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy \\n(CMIE)Source: RBI Note: BEI stands for Business Expectation Index\\nThe credit boom in the first decade increased the banking sector advances to the non-financial sector \\nfrom 36.5 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 57.3 per cent in 2014 (Bank for International Settlements). This \\nled to the RBI imposing a more stringent assessment of NPAs. Consequently, NPAs rose from 4.3 per \\ncent of gross bank advances in FY15 to 11.2 per cent in FY18. However, with the enforcement of the IBC code and a more disciplined approach to credit disbursements, NPA fell to 7.3 per cent in FY21 \\nand to a seven-year low of 5.0 per cent in September 2022. The Capital-to-Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio \\n(CRAR) and provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) have also improved and stood at 16.0 per cent and \\n71.5 per cent, respectively, in September 2022. With well-capitalised banks ready and willing to lend \\nand corporates financially stronger and willing to borrow, the credit-investment cycle is poised for an upturn in the third decade.\\nSupply Response of Industry\\n9.7 The supply response of the industry to the demand stimulus has been robust, as seen \\nin high-frequency indicators. The PMI-Manufacturing, for example, has remained in the \\nexpansionary zone for 18 months since July 2021. In December 2022, the sub-indices of the PMI-Manufacturing indicated an easing pace of input cost pressures, improving supplier delivery times, robust export orders, and future output. The moderation in input cost inflation has also led to an easing in the momentum of output prices. However, the pace of expansion in new export orders decreased, reflecting a subdued global demand. \\n9.8 The sustained growth of manufacturing output is also seen within the overall IIP producing \\nconsumer durables in sync with the “pent-up” consumption demand. Robust growth in the \\nproduction of capital goods and infrastructure/construction goods is indicative of the beginnings of an investment cycle in the private sector in the next financial year. 266\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure IX.2: PMI Manufacturing remains in \\nexpansionary zoneFigure IX.3: Sub-indices of IIP growing at a \\nhealthy pace (apr-Nov) \\n203040506070\\nMar-20\\nJun-20\\nSep-20\\nDec-20\\nMar-21\\nJun-21\\nSep-21\\nDec-21\\nMar-22\\nJun-22\\nSep-22\\nDec-22Index\\n30507090110130150\\nManu\\nfacturingCapital\\ngoodsInfra/\\nconstruction\\ngoodsConsumer\\nDurablesIndexFY21 FY22 FY23\\nSource: IHS Markit Source: MoSPI\\n9.9\\u2003The eight core industries of coal, fertilisers, cement, steel, electricity, refinery products, \\ncrude oil, and natural gas are critical in meeting the demand for inputs across industries. The growth in these industries has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity. Their growth underscores the importance that nations have been attaching to the indigenous presence of core capacities in the aftermath of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict breaking down the global supply chain.\\nFigure IX.4: Steady Growth in components of Index of core Industries\\n205080110140170200\\nCoal Crude Oil Natural gas Refinery\\nProductsFertilisers Steel Cement ElectricityIndexFY21 FY22 FY23April-November\\nSource: Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)\\n9.10\\u2003Growth in industrial output would have been higher, but for some constraints it faced in \\nthe first half of FY23. Seasonality has contributed to constraining the growth of production in respect of mining and quarrying, and construction, as total rainfall in Q2 of FY23 was about 12 per cent higher than in Q2 of FY22. Further, as higher rainfall cooled temperatures, electricity demand fell, and hence output rose by less than 5 per cent in Q2 of FY23 over Q2 of FY22. 267\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nFigure IX.5: Gv a  construction (a proxy for construction output)  \\nconstrained by Higher Rainfall\\n0.01.02.03.04.0\\n02004006008001,000\\nJun- 19\\nSep- 19\\nDe c-19\\nMar-20\\nJun- 20\\nSep- 20\\nDe c-20\\nMar-21\\nJun- 21\\nSep- 21\\nDe c-21\\nMar-22\\nJun- 22\\nSep- 22\\n₹  Lakh CroreMillimetresAc tual Rainfall Real GVA Constr uction (RHS)\\nSource: MoSPI\\n9.11\\u2003Manufacturing output appears to have been constrained by a large build-up in inventory. \\nFor five consecutive quarters ending in Q2 of FY23, an increase in stocks had accumulated to more than 1.3 per cent of the annual GDP. A typical cycle of change-in-stocks juxtaposed with the growth of manufacturing GV A (a proxy for manufacturing output) suggests that the build-up of stock allows manufacturing to slow its pace with the accumulated stock meeting current demand. When stocks start shrinking, manufacturing output increases to meet current demand and replenish stocks before the onset of the next cycle. Stock build-up appears to have thus played an important role in keeping the growth of manufacturing output restrained in Q2. \\nFigure IX.6: Gv a  Manufacturing slowing with build-up in stocks and elevated global uncertainty \\n-0.20.00.20.40.6\\n02468\\nJun-19\\nSep-19\\nDec-19\\nMar-20\\nJun-20\\nSep-20\\nDec-20\\nMar-21\\nJun-21\\nSep-21\\nDec-21\\nMar-22\\nJun-22\\nSep-22\\n₹ Lakh Crore₹ Lakh CroreReal GVA Manufacturing Change in stocks (RHS)\\nUseof stock to \\nsupport \\ndemandModeration in \\nstocking and \\nmanufacturing  \\namid uncertain \\nexternal \\ndemand \\noutlook  Restocking\\nsupported by increased \\nmanfuacturing \\nSource: MoSPI; Note: Change in stocks refers to change in stocks of GFCF .\\n9.12\\u2003The manufacturing landscape shows uneven growth across various categories.

Chemicals and chemical products such as caustic soda, soda ash, fertilisers and petroleum products have also performed well, contributing to sustaining the growth momentum in the agriculture sector while increasing exports. At the same time, a few product categories, including textiles, apparel and leather, have been showing tepid growth, as export demand for these products has been mellowing with the slowing of global output and demand. Growth in pharmaceutical output has slowed due to an unfavourable base effect and the waning of the pandemic.\\nTable IX.2: Growth in Manufacturing Sectors (Per cent, YoY)\\n<0 >0 but <5 >5\\n Weightsapr-\\n22May-\\n22Jun-\\n22Jul-\\n22aug-\\n22Sep-\\n22oct-\\n22Nov-\\n22\\nFood Products 5.3 3.8 10.1 5.1 -2.6 0.7 4.0 -3.7 9.9\\nBeverages 1 29.2 130.3 45.7 13.1 6.4 12.3 2.7 8.2\\nTobacco Products 0.8 22 21.4 52.7 -9.1 -12.8 -0.7 -14.3 -5.0\\nTextiles 3.3 -0.4 5.9 -3.1 -9.0 -12.5 -13.9 -18.7 -9.0\\nWearing Apparel 1.3 55.2 69.9 42.6 15.1 -18.3 -21.6 -36.6 -11.7\\nLeather And Related Products 0.5 5 47.5 1.9 -13.5 -16.0 -17.5 -25.5 -2.0\\nWood And Products Of Wood And \\nCork0.2 4.1 54.1 14.4 7.9 -7.9 -3.7 -14.8 -0.5\\nPaper And Paper Products 0.9 -1.9 9.7 8.3 -0.2 -0.1 6.2 -8.2 -2.3\\nPrinting and Reproduction Of Recorded Media0.7 30.1 43 45.1 41.2 27.6 29.1 13.5 22.1\\nCoke And Refined Petroleum Products 11.8 10.6 18.1 17.4 7.2 6.6 9.7 -1.0 -9.8\\nChemicals And Chemical Products 7.9 4.4 24.3 14.8 7.2 5.7 6.4 -2.5 6.2\\nPharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical And Botanical Products5 -5.5 -13.4 -4.6 -4.7 -17.6 -15.1 -21.2 10.0\\nRubber And Plastics Products 2.4 -1.5 8.7 5.7 -2.2 -4.4 -2.8 -2.1 5.6\\nOther Non-Metallic Mineral Products 4.1 6.9 22.1 19.6 0.0 1.4 9.7 -3.7 19.8\\nBasic Metals 12.8 6.9 16.5 7.2 6.7 4.0 5.7 4.4 8.1\\nFabricated Metal Products, 2.7 -0.4 29.2 14.3 -4.1 -14.4 14.6 -11.8 8.2\\nComputer, Electronic And Optical Products1.6 6.3 28.7 43.8 2.8 3.3 -0.2 -11.8 3.0\\nElectrical Equipment 3 8.3 59.6 11 -16.1 -28.5 -31.0 -33.0 1.2\\nMachinery And Equipment N.E.C. 4.8 5.4 38.8 19.9 4.1 2.9 6.4 -7.2 20.8\\nMotor Vehicles, Trailers And Semi-Trailers4.9 6.5 87.3 31.2 17.8 22.7 29.1 12.2 22.2269\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\n Weightsapr-\\n22May-\\n22Jun-\\n22Jul-\\n22aug-\\n22Sep-\\n22oct-\\n22Nov-\\n22\\nOther Transport Equipment 1.8 -1.5 126.6 36.2 -1.2 7.8 14.8 -8.1 24.0\\nFurniture 0.1 59.3 73.7 31.8 32.4 44.1 30.3 6.4 15.7\\nOther manufacturing 0.9 -3.2 18.5 26.4 6.9 4.2 4.8 -31.1 13.1\\nSource: MoSPI\\nRobust Growth in Bank credit to Industry\\n9.13\\u2003Growth in bank credit has kept pace with industrial growth, with a sequential surge \\nevident since January 2022. While a large share of bank credit continues to be assigned to large industries, credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase in part assisted by the introduction of the ECLGS, which supports around 1.2 crore businesses of which 95 per cent are MSMEs \\n1. The impact of ECLGS on increasing the growth of credit to MSME was felt most \\nduring the pandemic impacted years of 2020 and 2021. It continued in 2022 as the scheme was extended to March 2023. Furthermore, growth in credit to MSME was buttressed by rebounding consumption levels, particularly in the services sector. Consequently, the share of MSMEs in gross credit offtake to the industry rose from 17.7 per cent in January 2020 to 23.7 per cent in November 2022. While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in credit demanded by MSMEs, large industries have also begun to increase the pace of their credit offtake since the beginning of FY23. With the spread between corporate bond yields and marginal costs of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) narrowing, and the volatility in the corporate bond market remaining high, corporates appear to be shifting their sources of financing from bond markets to bank capital, where rates have remained stable and predictable. Robust growth in credit demand combined with rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses’ optimism regarding future demand.   \\nFigure IX.7: Double-digit credit growth in Industry driven by MSMes \\n -10010203040\\nJan-21\\nFeb-21\\nMar-21\\nApr-21\\nMay-21\\nJun-21\\nJul-21\\nAug-21\\nSep-21\\nOct-21\\nNov-21\\nDec-21\\nJan-22\\nFeb-22\\nMar-22\\nApr-22\\nMay-22\\nJun-22\\nJul-22\\nAug-22\\nSep-22\\nOct-22\\nNov-22Per centMSME Large Industry Non Food Credit\\nSource: RBI\\n1\\u2002As per the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd.

The government has implemented an investor-friendly FDI policy under which FDI up to 100 per cent is permitted through automatic route in most sectors. India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits, removing regulatory barriers, developing infrastructure, and improving the business environment.   \\nBox IX.2: FDI Policy Reforms to bolster Investment\\n• India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits and removing \\nregulatory barriers to attracting increased investments, in addition to developing infrastructure \\nand improving the business environment. To make India a more attractive investment destination, \\nthe Government has implemented several radical and transformative FDI reforms across sectors such as Defence, Pension, e-commerce activities etc. \\n• In FY20, 100 per cent FDI under automatic route was permitted for the sale of coal, and coal mining activities, including associated processing infrastructure, subject to provisions of relevant acts. 26 per cent FDI under the government route has been permitted for uploading/ streaming \\nof News & Current Affairs through Digital Media. 100 per cent FDI has been permitted in \\nIntermediaries or Insurance Intermediaries , including insurance brokers, reinsurance brokers, \\ninsurance consultants, corporate agents, third-party administrators, Surveyors and Loss Assessors and such other entities as may be notified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority from time to time.272\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n• To curb opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the Covid-19 pandemic, \\nthe government amended the FDI policy, according to which an entity of a country which shares \\na land border with India or where the beneficial owner of investment into India is situated in \\nor is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route. Further, in the event of the transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly or \\nindirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction/purview of the said \\npolicy amendment, such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require government \\napproval.\\n• To simplify the approval process of foreign Investment and to promote ease of doing business, \\nthe erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) was abolished in May 2017, and a \\nnew regime has been put in place. Under the new regime, the process for granting FDI approvals \\nhas been simplified, wherein the work relating to the processing of applications for FDI has been delegated to the concerned Ministries/ Departments, and DPIIT is the nodal department for \\nfacilitating the process. \\n• A revamped portal, “Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal (FIF Portal)”, has been launched as \\nthe online single-point interface of the Government of India for investors to facilitate Foreign \\nDirect Investment.

Some of the measures undertaken include the modification of the definition of MSMEs; the provision of ₹20,000 crore subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs, ₹50,000 crore equity infusion through Self Reliant India fund; the waiving of the global tender requirement for procurement of up to ₹200 crore; launching of the Udyam portal for MSME registration, a paperless, zero-cost registration portal that is based on self-declaration and only requires Aadhaar. Registrations on the Udyam portal crossed the one-crore mark in August 2022, surpassing the total registration done in the past 14 years under the old regime in just 2.5 years. As of 7\\nth January 2022, the portal has a total registration count of 1.32 \\ncrore, of which 1.27 crore have been classified as micro-enterprises. Enterprises registered on the portal employ 9.6 crore people, of which 2.3 crore are women. There are 1.5 lakh exporting units, which have contributed a cumulative ₹9.7 lakh crore worth of exports. \\n9.19\\u2003The government’s initiative of the Samadhaan Portal, set up under the Micro, Small and \\nMedium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act to monitor the outstanding dues to the MSME sector, is helping MSMEs in resolving their cashflow difficulties. As of 7\\nth January 2022, the \\nportal has received a total of 1.3 lakh applications, of which 16.8 per cent have been disposed while 25.0 per cent are currently under consideration, and 25.1 per cent have been rejected. In order to fast-track this process, the government has instructed Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and all companies with a turnover of ₹200 crore or more to get themselves onboarded on the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform for facilitating the discounting of trade receivables of MSMEs through multiple financiers. CHAMPIONS, the single-window grievance redressal portal for MSMEs launched by the Ministry of MSME in June 2020, has received 56,825 grievances as of 16\\nth January 2023, of which 55,878 grievances have been \\nresponded to. The portal continues to be improved through initiatives such as the localisation of the portal in 11 regional languages and the introduction of a Chatbot. \\n9.20\\u2003The government has also initiated the ‘Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance’ \\nscheme (RAMP) in FY23. The World Bank-supported scheme aims at strengthening institutions and governance at the Centre and State, improving Centre-State linkages and partnerships and improving access of MSMEs to market and credit, technology upgradation and addressing issues of delayed payments and greening of MSMEs. The RAMP programme will be implemented over a period of five years. The total outlay for the scheme is ₹6,062.4 crore, out of which ₹3750 crore would be a loan from the World Bank, and the Government of India would fund the remaining ₹2312.4 crore.\\n9.21\\u2003The bouquet of measures introduced by the government aided the resilience of the MSME \\nsector. Data from the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Corporation (NCGTC) shows that as of 30\\nth November 2022, 1.2 crore MSME units availed the ECLGS scheme and raised collateral-\\nfree resources to the tune of ₹3.6 lakh crore. A recent CIBIL report2 showed that 83 per cent of \\nthe borrowers who availed of the ECLGS were micro-enterprises, and more than half of these borrowers had an exposure of less than ₹10 lakh. The NPA rate in banks for the category of MSME borrowers who availed of ECLGS was lower than the category that did not avail of the scheme.

Electronics, supported by continuously improving communication services, will significantly enhance productivity, efficient service delivery, and social transformation. The domestic electronics industry, as of FY20, is valued at US$118 billion. India aims to reach US$300 billion worth of electronics manufacturing and US$ 120 billion in exports by FY26\\n3, supported by the vision of a US$ 1 \\ntrillion digital economy by 2025. Improvement in manufacturing and export over the past five years ensures that India is on the right trajectory to achieve this target. Electronic goods were among the top five commodity groups exhibiting positive export growth in November 2022, with the exports in this segment growing YoY by 55.1 per cent.\\n9.23\\u2003The major drivers of growth in this industry are mobile phones, consumer electronics, and \\nindustrial electronics. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from six crore units in FY15 to 31 crore units in FY22. These numbers are expected to improve as more domestic and global players set up and expand their bases in India.

Hence, this will further enhance export competitiveness and increase India’s participation in the global value chain. The industrial electronics sector is also seeing growth due to improved digitisation and robotics applications in Industry 4.0. Additionally, the impetus on Smart Cities and the Internet of Things (IoT) will streamline the demand for smart and automated electronics.\\nFigure IX.12: Robust growth in electronics exports\\n3.95.27.4\\n5.98.913.8\\n0481216\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\\nApr-NovUS$ Billion\\nSource: DGCI&S\\n9.24\\u2003Some of the initiatives and incentives provided by the government to nurture and \\nenhance the electronics manufacturing base include the PLI scheme for Large Scale Electronics \\nManufacturing, the PLI scheme for IT hardware, the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of \\nElectronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS). Additionally, under the Programme for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India, the Cabinet \\napproved the comprehensive development of a sustainable semiconductor and display ecosystem \\nin the country with an outlay of ₹76,000 crore, the details of which are in Box 3. These schemes and initiatives are expected to boost India’s manufacturing capacity, reduce import dependence, \\nand also contribute to achieving the country’s ambitions of becoming a major player in global \\nsupply chains.\\nBox IX.3: Incentives to encourage semiconductor manufacturing  \\nin the US and India\\nThe global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the frailties in the supply \\nchains of many goods and services. One product that was under the spotlight was the semiconductor \\n(more commonly referred to as ‘chips’), and the effect of its shortage was particularly amplified in \\nthe automotive industry globally. While the situation has limped back to normalcy, it has prompted a policy response by countries towards diversifying the semiconductor supply chain.276\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nOne of the most notable policies is the United States’ Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce \\nSemiconductors and Science Act, 2022 (CHIPS and Science Act, 2022). The legislation aims to \\ncatalyse investments in the domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity of the US. The country \\nproduces about 10 per cent of the world’s semiconductors and relies heavily on East Asia to import chips. The CHIPS and Science Act directs US$ 280 billion in spending over the next ten years, with \\nthe bulk of it going to Research and Development (R&D).\\nFigure a: Incentives under the cHIPS and Science act, 2022\\nR&D\\n71%Manufacturing\\n19%Tax Credits\\n9%Leading edge tech \\nand wireless \\nsupply chains\\n1%\\nSource: whitehouse.gov.in; McKinsey and Co.\\nIn the pursuit of Aatmanirbharta and with the objective of plugging itself into the global value \\nchain, India has announced multiple incentives to attract investment for developing a semiconductor \\nmanufacturing ecosystem. To this end, a comprehensive programme with an outlay of ₹76,000 \\ncrore (approx. US$ 10 billion) was approved by the Government of India in September 2022. The government will provide financial support for 50 per cent of the capital expenditure to be incurred \\nby the investing firms. \\nTable a: various incentives under Semiconductor Scheme\\nScheme for Financial Support R&D Support\\nSetting up of Semiconductor Fabs in India50 per cent of firm’s \\nCapexUp to 2.5 per cent of the scheme outlay\\nSetting up Display Fabs50 per cent of firm’s CapexUp to 2.5 per cent of the scheme outlay\\nSetting up of Compound Semiconductors / Silicon \\nPhotonics / Sensors Fab and Semiconductor \\nATMP /OSAT facilities50 per cent of firm’s CapexUp to 2.5 per cent of the scheme outlay\\nSource: MEITY\\nNote: ATMP stands for assembly, testing, marking, and packaging.

The scheme’s objectives include the nurturing \\nand facilitation of domestic companies of semiconductor design, achieving significant indigenisation \\nof semiconductor products and IPs deployed across the country, and strengthening the infrastructure \\nfor design. The scheme will provide financial support of 50 per cent of eligible expenditure on \\nthe design, subject to a ceiling of ₹15 crore per applicant and a deployment-linked incentive of \\n4 per cent to 6 per cent of net sales achieved over five years, subject to a ceiling of ₹30 crore  \\nper applicant.\\nWhile these are early stages, global and domestic players have evinced interest based on the prospects \\nfor the semiconductor industry in India and the fiscal incentives provided. Israel-based International \\nSemiconductor Consortium has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to invest ₹ 22,900 \\ncrore in Karnataka to set up India’s first chip-making plant. Domestic players such as Vedanta and \\nTata have also indicated plans to establish semiconductor fabs in the country.\\nCoaI Industry: Key in maintaining energy self-reliance during uncertain times\\n9.25\\u2003At the beginning of the fiscal year, coal availability became a challenge for India’s largely \\nthermal-based power generation plants because of a resurgence in economic activity and the emergence of intense heat waves from early March to mid-May of 2022, increasing the demand for power in the country. In addition, in the wake of rising international coal prices, the power sector curtailed coal import drastically from 69 MT in FY20 to 45 MT in FY21 and further to 27 MT in FY22. As domestic coal production could not keep pace with its rising demand from power-generating plants, its availability got limited. Resultantly, in April 2022, even as coal offtake rose to meet higher demand, coal stock with power plants, as on 31st April 2022, fell to 8 days from 12 days a year ago. \\n9.26\\u2003The government of India undertook several steps on a priority basis through April and \\nMay of 2022 to address the supply constraints of coal. First, all generators were asked to import coal to the extent of 10 per cent of their requirements (as against 4 per cent earlier). Penalties, including curtailment of domestic coal entitlements, were announced if power plants failed to import coal. Second, Section 11 of the Electricity Act 2003 (Act) was invoked to direct imported coal-based plants to run at full capacity with the assurance that their enhanced cost of operation would be compensated. Third, tolling was enabled, which allowed states to transfer their allotted coal to private generators near the mines instead of transporting it too far away from state generators. This move eased the burden on the availability of railway rakes. Fourth, Rural Electrification Corporation (REC)/ Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and commercial banks were advised to facilitate the availability of additional working capital to power generating plants.278\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nFigure IX.13: adequate coal Production Figure IX.14: Improving coal Stock\\n304050607080\\nAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecThousand TonnesFY20 FY21\\nFY22 FY23\\n048121620\\nJan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\nMay\\nJun\\nJul\\nAug\\nSep\\nOct\\nNov\\nDecNo. of Days2021 2022\\nSource: Ministry of Coal \\nNote: Production by Coal India Limited (CIL), Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) and Captives/OthersSource: National Power Portal\\n9.27\\u2003Well-timed measures have placed India in a better position to cater to excess energy \\ndemand. The coal production for FY23 is estimated to increase to 911 million tonnes, about 17 per cent higher compared to the previous year. In April-December, 2022, coal production rose by 14 per cent on a YoY basis and was 21 per cent higher than the pre-pandemic of FY20. Further, the coal stock at power plants improved to 12 days as of 30 December 2022 compared to 10 days on 30\\n June 2022 and 8 days a year ago.\\n9.28\\u2003Different measures have been initiated towards achieving self-reliance in coal production, including private participation in coal production, FDI under the automatic route, auctioning of coal blocks for commercial production, expansion of existing mines and opening of new mines, greater use of mass production technology in mining, mechanisation of loading, development of evacuation infrastructure etc. \\n9.29\\u2003The coal industry is expected to grow at 6-7 per cent annually to reach a production \\nlevel of 1 billion tonnes by FY26 and about 1.5 billion tonnes by 2030. The enhanced domestic coal production is expected to meet domestic coal demand, replace substitutable imports, and escalate exports. There has also been a persistent effort to improve system capacity utilisation from about 80 per cent to above 90 per cent.\\nRe-invigorated infrastructure sector & construction activity to drive steel industry.\\n9.30\\u2003Steel Sector plays a pivotal role in crucial sectors such as construction, infrastructure, automobile, engineering and defence. Over the years, the steel sector has witnessed tremendous growth. The country is now a global force in steel production and the 2\\nnd largest crude steel \\nproducer in the world. The steel sector’s performance in the current fiscal year has been robust, with cumulative production and consumption of finished steel at 88 MT and 86 MT, respectively, during April-December 2022, higher than the corresponding period during the previous four 279\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nyears. The growth in finished steel production is aided by double-digit growth in consumption \\n(11 per cent on a YoY basis), bolstered by a pick-up in the infrastructure sector significantly driven by increased Capex of the government. \\n9.31\\u2003Further, 67 applications from 30 companies have been selected under the PLI Scheme \\nfor speciality steel. This will attract a committed investment of ₹42,500 crore, with an increase in capacity by almost 26 million tons and an employment generation potential of nearly 70,000 people. Further, domestic steel makers’ stable credit profiles, deleveraged balance sheets, and robust cash accrual support continue to support their capex. Iron and steel exports moderated in the first eight months of the current fiscal owing to a slowdown in the global economy, particularly in Europe and China, and export duty levied to enhance domestic availability. Yet, iron and steel exports are higher by 20 per cent over the corresponding pre-pandemic levels of FY20. \\nFigure IX.15: Increasing Steel Production and \\nconsumption (apr-Dec)Figure IX.16: a slight moderation in Iron and \\nSteel exports during FY23\\n30405060708090\\nStee l Consumption Stee l ProductionMillion TonnesFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\\n048121620\\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\\nApr-NovUS$ Billion\\nSource: Joint Plant Committee (JPC), Ministry of Steel Source: DGCI&S\\n9.32\\u2003In the future, the government’s thrust towards infrastructure projects, pick-up in \\nconstruction and real estate activity, and healthy demand from the automobile sector augur well for the demand for steel products. However, export demand may remain subdued with the global slowdown. \\nGovernment support to help textile Industry weather current challenges.\\n9.33\\u2003The Textile industry is one of the country’s most significant sources of employment generation, with an estimated 4.5 crore people directly engaged in this sector, including a large number of women and the rural population. In the current financial year, the textile industry has been facing the challenge of moderating exports compared to FY22. However, the levels in the eight six months still prevail, 9.5 per cent higher than the corresponding pre-pandemic level of FY20. Export of readymade garments registered a growth of 3.2 per cent YoY basis during the same period.

The parks will not only reduce logistics costs and improve the competitiveness of Indian Textiles but also boost employment generation, attract domestic investment and FDI, and position India firmly in the global textile market. The parks are expected to create a total of one lakh direct and two lakh indirect employment.\\n9.35\\u2003Further, to boost the production capacity, the government launched the Textile PLI \\nScheme with an approved outlay of ₹10,683 crore over five years starting from 1st January 2022 to promote investments and increase the production of Man-Made Fibre (MMF) Apparel, MMF Fabrics and Products of Technical Textiles. This will enable the textile sector to achieve size and scale, enhancing export competitiveness.

First, it aims to strengthen the existing infrastructure facilities by providing financial assistance to pharma clusters to create common facilities. Second, it upgrades the production facilities of MSMEs to meet national and international regulatory standards by providing interest subvention or capital subsidy on their capital loans. Third, it also promotes knowledge and awareness about the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry by undertaking studies, building databases and bringing industry leaders, academia and policymakers together to share their knowledge and experience.\\nIndia becomes the world’s 3rd largest automobile market\\n9.39\\u2003The automobile sector is a key driver of India’s economic growth.

Higher \\nborrowing costs and tempering global demand are expected to be near-term hurdles.  Amongst structural issues, the increase in long-term third-party vehicle insurance premiums has increased the total upfront insurance cost by about 10-11 per cent, especially for two-wheelers. Therefore, the two-wheeler segment is the most affected and witnessed the lowest sales in the last ten years. Addressing these challenges will boost the automobile industry.  \\nIndia’s Prospects as a Key Player in the Global value chain\\n9.42\\u2003The risk of supply chain shocks has never been more palpable than today, following compounding crises from the US-China trade war, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. In this fast-evolving context, as global companies adapt their manufacturing and supply chain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global manufacturing hub this decade. The three primary assets to capitalise on this unique opportunity are the potential for significant domestic demand, the Government’s drive to encourage manufacturing, and a distinct demographic edge, including a considerable proportion of the young workforce. The manufacturing sector in India is gradually shifting to more automated and process-driven manufacturing, which is expected to increase efficiency and boost the production of the industry. The ‘Make-in-India’ Initiative was launched in 2014 to make India a hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation. Since then, it has facilitated investment, fostered innovation and built world-class infrastructure. The progress made in infrastructure development is discussed in chapter 12 \"Physical and Digital Infrasturcture: lifting potential growth\". \\nMake in India 2.0 and the PLI schemes\\n9.43\\u2003To further enhance India’s integration in the global value chain, ‘Make in India 2.0’ is now 285\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nfocusing on 27 sectors, which include 15 manufacturing sectors and 12 service sectors. Amongst \\nthese, 24 sub-sectors have been chosen while keeping in mind the Indian industries’ strengths and competitive edge, the need for import substitution, the potential for export and increased employability. Efforts are on to boost the growth of the sub-sectors in a holistic and coordinated manner.\\nFigure IX.27: 24 Sub-Sectors under Make in India 2.0\\nFurniture\\n Air-Conditioners\\nLeather ad \\nFootwear\\nReady -to-Eat\\nFisheries\\n Agri Produce\\n Auto Components\\n Aluminium\\nElectronics\\n Agrochemicals\\n Steel\\n Textile\\nEV Components & \\nIntegrated Circuits\\nEthanol\\n Ceramics\\n Set-Top Boxes\\nRobotics\\n Televisions\\nClose Circuit \\nCameras\\nToys\\nDrones\\n Medical Devices\\n Sporting Goods\\n Gym Equipments\\nSource: DPIIT\\n9.44\\u2003In pursuit of the objectives of the Make-in-India programme and with a vision to achieve \\nAatmanirbharta, the government launched the PLI scheme. The scheme is expected to attract a capex of approximately ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years. It has the potential to generate employment for over 60 lakh in India and increase the share of the manufacturing sector in total capital formation, which currently stands at around 17-20 per cent between FY12 and FY20. It is further believed that there will be a significant reduction in the trade deficit with domestic production substituting for imports. Sectors under which the PLI scheme has been announced currently constitute around 40 per cent of the total imports. The scheme, spread across 14 sectors, can enhance India’s annual manufacturing capex by 15 to 20 per cent from FY23. \\n9.45\\u2003PLI Scheme across these key specific sectors is poised to make Indian manufacturers \\nglobally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiencies; create economies of scale; and make India an integral part of the global value chain. The scheme will benefit the MSME ecosystem in the country. The anchor units built in every sector will require a new supplier base in the entire value chain. Most of these ancillary units will be built in the MSME sector. \\n9.46\\u2003As of 31\\nst December 2022, 717 applications have been approved under 14 Schemes. \\nMore than 100 MSMEs are among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as Bulk Drugs, Medical \\nDevices, Telecom, White Goods and Food Processing. As per recent reporting from implementing Ministries/ Departments, around ₹47,500 crore (US$ 6 billion) of actual investment has been made; production/ sales of ₹3.85 lakh crore (US$ 47 billion) of eligible products and employment 286\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\ngeneration of around 3 lakh has been reported and 106 per cent achievement of actual investment \\nreported versus the corresponding projections of FY227. Key sectors such as Large-Scale \\nElectronics Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Telecom & Networking Products, Food Processing and White Goods have contributed considerably to investment, production, sales and employment.\\n9.47\\u2003Some of the latest developments under the PLI programme include the launch of a design-\\nled PLI in June 2022 to promote the entire value chain in telecom manufacturing and to build a strong ecosystem for 5G as part of the PLI Scheme for Telecom & Networking products. Approvals under this Scheme have already been granted to eligible companies. In September 2022, the Cabinet recently approved PLI Scheme (Tranche II) on ‘National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules’, with an outlay of ₹19,500 crore to build an ecosystem for manufacturing of high-efficiency solar PV modules in India, thus reducing import dependence in the area of renewable energy. \\nBox IX.4: Shipbuilding Sector: achieving Self-Reliance  \\nand promoting Make in India\\nThe Shipbuilding industry is a strategically important industry due to its role in energy security, national \\ndefence and the development of the heavy engineering industry. It has the potential to increase the \\ncontribution of the industry and the services sector to the national GDP. With its immense direct and \\nindirect linkages with most other leading industries, such as steel, aluminum, electrical machinery and equipment etc., and its huge dependence on infrastructure and services sectors of the economy, the \\nshipbuilding industry has the potential to strengthen the mission of an ‘Aatmanirbhar’ Bharat. The \\nIndian Navy (IN) shipbuilding projects currently in progress at various Indian shipyards are poised to \\nprovide the requisite impetus to the industry. With the objective to achieve strategic independence in \\nshipbuilding and development of niche technology, as of date, more than 130 IN warships have been constructed at Indian shipyards, and presently, 41 of 43 ships and submarines are being constructed \\nat various public and private sector Indian shipyards. These initiatives, through various channels, are \\ncontributing to economic growth and employment in the country.\\nBoost to ancillary Industry\\nShipbuilding with its links to other ancillary industries, including steel, engineering equipment, \\nport infrastructure, trade and shipping services has the potential to create a collaborative production eco-system. With the development of these ancillary industries, the sector generates opportunities \\nfor smaller businesses and strengthens supply chain networks. It is noteworthy that a significant \\nproportion of value addition, approximately 65 per cent, in the construction of a ship is derived from manufacturers of shipboard materials, equipment, and systems. \\nSignificant Investment and employment Generation Multiplier effects\\nBased on International shipbuilding statistics, if one takes a conservative Marginal Consumption to \\nGDP Ratio (MCGR) of 0.45 for the shipbuilding sector, the investment multiplier would be approx. \\naround 1.82. For example, an injection of approx. ₹1.5 lakh crore in naval shipbuilding projects \\nwould accrue a circulation of ₹2.73 lakh crore in the shipbuilding sector due to the multiplier ef fect.\\nAmong manufacturing activities, shipbuilding has one of the highest employment multipliers \\nof 6.4\\n8. It is capable of generating mass employment in remote, coastal and rural areas, thereby \\n7\\u2002https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1884181\\n8\\u2002https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1593424287\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nabsorbing the labour migrating from agricultural pursuits to manufacturing facilities established by \\nshipyards and their ancillary industries. The Indigenisation initiatives implemented by the IN have \\nresulted in a significant infusion of economic activity by creating employment opportunities for MSMEs \\nand other industries. For instance, the recently commissioned INS Vikrant alone engaged approximately 500 MSMEs, 12,000 employees from ancillary industries, and 2,000 shipyard employees.\\nFurther, a study undertaken by the IN for the construction of seven P17A ships reveals that around \\nthree-fourths of the total project cost of warships is invested back into the Indian economy. This investment is ploughed back into the economy through indigenous sourcing of raw materials, \\ndevelopment of equipment and systems installed onboard ships and other manpower services. \\nBesides benefiting the ancillary industries and creating massive employment opportunities, an \\nindigenous shipping and shipbuilding industry can also reduce freight bills and forex outgo, thereby \\nreducing the current account deficit.\\nThus, we see that the strong forward and backward linkages of the shipbuilding sector play an \\nimportant part in the creation of a self-relient India.\\nFostering Innovation  \\n9.48\\u2003The government’s efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, \\nfunding, industry-academia partnership and mentorship. The government has also strengthened its IPR regime by modernising the IP office, reducing legal compliances and facilitating IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries and others. This has resulted in a 46 per cent growth in the domestic filing of patents over 2016-2021, signalling India’s transition towards a knowledge-based economy.\\n9.49\\u2003These measures have begun to pay dividends. The Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks \\nthe countries based on innovation performance, comprising around 80 indicators, including measures on the political environment, education, infrastructure and knowledge creation of each economy. As per the GII 2022 report, India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022 since the inception of the GII in 2007 by improving its rank from 81 in 2015 to 40 in 2022. Further, India became the most innovative nation in the lower middle-income group overtaking Vietnam (48\\nth) and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\\nBox XI.5: ‘Flipping and Reverse Flipping: the recent developments in Start-ups’\\nIndia ranks amongst the largest startup ecosystems in the world. An impressive 9 lakh+ direct jobs \\nhave been created by the DPIIT recognised startups (self-reported), with a notable 64 per cent increase \\nin 2022 over the average number of new jobs created in the last three years. About 48 per cent of our \\nstartups are from Tier II & III cities, a testimony of our grassroots’ tremendous potential.\\nVarious targeted initiatives of the Government have given a major boost to start-ups. For instance, \\nunder the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies get recognised as Start-ups by DPIIT to access \\na host of tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) fast-tracking. As part \\nof the umbrella schemes of the National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations \\n(NIDHI) and atal Innovation Mission (aIM), entrepreneurship and innovation are fostered across \\nthe start-up ecosystem in the country. The Fund of Funds for Start-ups (FFS) and Credit Guarantee288\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nScheme for Start-ups (CGSS) support seed funding and successive credit needs. The R&D \\nplatform for technology sectors is offered by schemes such as MeitY Start-up Hub (MSH) and \\nTechnology Incubation and Development of entrepreneurs (TIDe 2.0), among others. \\nEngaging Indian start-ups with global peers is another essential pillar of Start-up India and is facilitated through Government-to-Government partnerships, participation in international forums, \\nand hosting of global events. Further, the Support for International Patent Protection in e&IT \\n(SIP-eIT) Scheme encourages international patent filing by Indian MSMEs and start-ups\\n9. \\nFigure a: Jobs created by Start-ups\\n4388132161198269\\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022ThousandsTotal Number of Jobs Created (self-reported) by DPIIT \\nRecognised Start-ups\\nNote: Data as on 17th January 2023\\nWhile external support from the government has made it relatively easier than before for entrepreneurship to thrive, there are several inherent challenges faced by start-ups. Be it ever-elusive \\nfunding, revenue generation struggles, lack of easy access to supportive infrastructure, or wading \\nthrough the regulatory environment and tax structures. It has also been observed that many Indian companies have been getting headquartered overseas, especially in destinations with favourable legal \\nenvironments and taxation policies. The technical jargon for this may be identified as ‘Flipping’, \\nwhich is the process of transferring the entire ownership of an Indian company to an overseas entity, \\naccompanied by a transfer of all IP and all data hitherto owned by the Indian company. It effectively \\ntransforms an Indian company into a 100 per cent subsidiary of a foreign entity, with the founders and investors retaining the same ownership via the foreign entity, having swapped all shares.\\nTypically, “Flipping” happens at the early stage of the Start-ups, driven by commercial, taxation and \\npersonal preferences of founders and investors. Some companies decide to “Flip” because the major market of their product is offshore. Sometimes, investor preferences like access to incubators drive \\nthe companies to “Flip” as they insist on a particular domicile. Some companies prefer to domicile in \\ncountries where they would like to access Capital Market later for better valuations and ticket size. Better protection and enforcement of IP and tax treatment of Licensing revenue from IP, residential \\nstatus of Founders, and agile corporate structures have been the reasons for “Flipping” in the Past.\\nIn popular holding company jurisdictions like Singapore, dividends received from a Singaporean \\ncompany/subsidiary are not taxed at the holding level.

This is a critical component since the \\ndividend is one of the most popular repatriation tools. There are no withholding taxes in the United \\nArab Emirates (Uae) under current legislation. These jurisdictions have tailor-made their policies \\nand tax and incentive structures to incentivise companies to store IPs and create Holding companies as Regional Headquarters. European jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, provide for participation \\nexemptions on dividends and capital gains (based on certain shareholding thresholds, i.e., 5 per cent and other tests). These exemptions are currently unavailable in India, and any migration of existing \\nstructures to India triggers capital gains tax. However, of late, with relatively easy access to Capital \\nthrough a vibrant Private Equity/Venture Capital Ecosystem, changes in rules regarding round-tripping, and the growing maturity of India’s capital markets have not only slowed down the Flipping, \\nbut companies are also exploring “Reverse Flipping”.\\nFigure B: effect of Flipping on the structure of the company\\nPre-Flipping Post-Flipping\\n \\n \\nTo accelerate ‘Reverse Flipping’, certain measures are possible, some of which are listed below:\\ni.

This has been done through various reforms that have led to increased investment inflows and economic growth. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalisation of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens, bring down costs and enhance the ease of doing business in India. Burdensome compliances with rules and regulations have been reduced through simplification, rationalisation, decriminalisation, and digitisation. Steps to promote manufacturing and investments include reduction in corporate taxes, public procurement and Phased Manufacturing Programme. \\n9.51\\u2003The DPIIT’s Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 (fifth edition), based on \\nthe implementation of reforms by States/UTs, was released on 30\\nth June 2022. It shows that \\n7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs as part of the BRAP 2020 assessment, thereby significantly enhancing the Ease of Doing Business across the country. Reducing the Compliance Burden (RCB) on businesses and citizens is a continuous exercise to leapfrog to the next level of governance excellence and improve Ease of Living. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances (as on 17\\nth January 2023). Specifically, more than \\n3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalised by Ministries and States/UTs based on details uploaded on DPIIT’s Regulatory Compliance Portal as on 17\\nth January 2023. Further, the NSWS was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve \\nthe ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvals and clearances. The portal is rapidly gaining traction amongst the investor community and, as of 10\\nth January 2023, has about 4.3 lakh plus unique visitors. 81,000+ approvals have been \\nfacilitated through NSWS, and 43,000+ approvals are currently under process. The portal will progressively onboard more approvals and licenses based on user /industry feedback. This portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of the various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments to enhance investor experience.\\nIndia and Industry 4.0\\n9.52\\u2003The advent of the fourth industrial revolution or industry 4.0 as it’s commonly referred to, has begun. The transformation integrates new technologies such as cloud computing, IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) into manufacturing processes, leading to efficiencies across the value chain. While the adoption of these technologies in the Indian manufacturing sector is underway, large-scale adoption is yet to happen. However, an enabling environment is rapidly developing. In recent years, India has made significant strides in internet penetration which is one of the key requisites of industry 4.0. The push towards self-reliance in semiconductor technology and production will help India erect another pillar of this revolution – hyper-efficient processing technology.\\n9.53\\u2003The government is cognisant of the importance of industry 4.0 in achieving the goals \\nof Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains. A few initiatives by the government include the SAMARTH (Smart Advanced Manufacturing and Rapid Transformation Hubs) Udyog Bharat 4.0 under the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, which aims to encourage technological solutions to Indian manufacturing 291\\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\\nunits through awareness programmes and demonstrations. Another initiative is the establishment \\nof the Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution in India in 2018, which looks to develop policy frameworks for emerging technologies. \\nconclusion and outlook\\n9.54\\u2003Despite global headwinds, industrial production expanded during FY23, backed by sustained demand conditions. The growth in bank credit has kept pace with industrial growth, with a sequential surge evident since January 2022. Credit to MSMEs has seen a significant increase in part, assisted by the introduction of the ECLGS. Amidst heightened global uncertainty, FDI in the manufacturing sector moderated in the first half of FY23. However, inflows stayed well above the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world.\\n9.55\\u2003On the positive side, easing input cost pressures owing to a fall in international commodity \\nprices augurs well for company margins. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector has been rising. It bodes well for new investment activity in creating additional capacity. Credit growth in the industry has also increased remarkably, suggesting that prospects for Capex investments by companies are brighter. The PLI schemes are set to unlock manufacturing capacity, boost exports, reduce import dependence and lead to job creation for both skilled and unskilled labour. On the downside, exports are slowing down and are likely to moderate along with the probable global economic slowdown. V olatile international commodity prices and supply disruptions in raw materials can weigh on industrial growth in the wake of new disruptions at the global level. The re-emergence of Covid-19 in China can trigger supply chain disruptions, as was the case during the pandemic period. On the other hand, if China returns to normalcy from Covid-19, there can be an increase in commodity demand - thus reversing the recent decline in commodity prices. Of course, the strength and duration of the recovery in commodity prices will be a function of many factors, such as the pace of China’s economic recovery and growth outlook in North America and Europe. Notwithstanding such open questions, industrial output in India should continue to grow steadily based on resilient domestic demand.  CHAPTER10\\nIndia’ s services sector witnessed a swift rebound in FY22 driven by growth in the contact-\\nintensive services sub-sector, which bore the maximum burden of the pandemic. This sub-sector completely recovered from the pre-pandemic level in Q2 of FY23, driven by the release of pent-up demand, ease of mobility restriction, and near-universal vaccination coverage. Going forward, strong momentum growth and an uptick in the High-Frequency Indicators (HFIs) for the contact-intensive services sector reflect a strong growth opportunity in the next fiscal. PMI services, indicative of service sector activity, has also witnessed a strong rebound in recent months with the retreating of the price pressures of inputs and raw materials.\\nIndia has been a major player in services trade, being among the top ten services exporting \\ncountries in 2021, having increased its share in world commercial services exports from 3 per cent in 2015 to 4 per cent in 2021. India’ s services exports have remained resilient during the Covid-19 pandemic and amid current geopolitical uncertainties, driven by higher demand for digital support, cloud services, and infrastructure modernisation catering to new challenges. \\nTo ensure the liberalisation of investment in various industries, the Government has permitted \\n100 per cent foreign participation in telecommunication services including all services and infrastructure providers, through the Automatic Route. The FDI ceiling in insurance companies was also raised from 49 to 74 per cent. Measures undertaken by the Government, such as the launch of the National Single-Window system and enhancement in the FDI ceiling through the automatic route, have played a significant role in facilitating investment.  \\nWith the waning of the pandemic and external shocks on account of the Russia-Ukraine \\nconflict, there is evidence of improvement in the performance of various services sub-sectors. The hotel industry is thriving with improvements in occupancy rate, increase in the Average Room Rate (ARR) and rise in Revenue Per Available Room (RevP AR) which are now much nearer to the pre-pandemic level of FY20. The tourism sector is also showing signs of revival, with foreign tourist arrivals in India in FY23 growing month-on-month with the resumption of scheduled international flights and the easing of Covid-19 regulations. The Real Estate sector has witnessed resilient growth in the current year, with housing sales and the launch of new houses surpassing in Q2 of FY23 the pre-pandemic level of Q2 of FY20. Information Technology-Business Process Management (IT-BPM) and the E-commerce industry have been exceptionally resilient during the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by accelerated technology adoption and digital transformation. The Government’ s push to boost the digital economy, growing internet penetration, rise in smartphone adoption and increased adoption of digital ServiceS : Source of \\nStrength293\\nServices: Source of Strength\\npayments have also given a renewed push to these industries. The introduction and piloting \\nof Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will also provide a significant boost to digital financial services. They may lay the framework for another generation of financial innovation.\\nintroduction\\n10.1 The Covid-19 pandemic hurt most sectors of the economy, with the effect particularly \\nprofound for contact-intensive services sectors like tourism, retail trade, hotel, entertainment, and recreation. On the other hand, non-contact services such as information, communication, financial, professional, and business services remained resilient. However, the services sector witnessed a swift rebound in FY22, growing Year-on-Year (YoY) at 8.4 per cent compared to a contraction of 7.8 per cent in the previous financial year. The improvement was driven by growth in the ‘Trade, Hotel, Transport, Storage, Communication and Services related to broadcasting’ sub-sector, which bore the maximum burden of the pandemic. The growth momentum has continued in FY23 as well. As per the First Advance Estimates, Gross Value Added (GV A) in the services sector is estimated to grow at 9.1 per cent in FY23, driven by 13.7 per cent growth in contact-intensive services sector.\\nfigure X.1: Broad-based growth in the Services sector\\n -30-20-1001020\\n0102030\\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23\\nPer cent  ₹ Lakh Crore  GVA in Services sector YoY growth (RHS)\\nSource: NSO, MOSPI\\n10.2 Even on a sequential basis, the rebound continued in Q2 of FY23, with the services sector \\nrecording 8.7 per cent sequential growth.

However, PMI services again witnessed a setback with the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The indicator moderated from May to September 2022 as economic uncertainty resulted in weaker sales growth and inflationary pressures restricting the upturn in business activity. Further, price pressures and unfavourable weather also dampened domestic demand.

However, WTO’s Services Trade Barometer Index reading fell to 98.3 for October 2022 (slightly below its baseline value of 100), well below the previous reading of 105.5 in June 2022 indicating that YoY growth in real commercial services began moderating in the third quarter of 2022 and may slow further in the fourth as well as into the first quarter of 2023 due to declining growth prospects in major service industry economies. Financial and ICT Services have been so far most resilient to the slowing global economy, whereas, construction services and container shipping fell into contraction territory. \\n10.7 Insofar as India is concerned, some headwinds may be observed in the coming months \\nbecause of the slowing growth in some of India’s major trading partners.

India will be one of the main drivers of global \\ninsurance industry growth over the next decade. Indian Insurance Market is the 10th largest in the \\nworld and is poised to become the 6th largest by 2032, ahead of Germany, Canada, Italy, and South Korea\\n2. The insurance regulator, IRDAI, has taken up the mission of universal insurance, which is \\nexpected to lead to a significant increase in insurance penetration such that, when India celebrates 100 years of its independence in 2047, every Indian has appropriate life, health, and property insurance \\ncover and every enterprise is supported by appropriate insurance solutions. Towards this objective, \\nthe insurance regulator has taken various steps to promote healthy growth of the insurance industry, rationalise the regulatory framework, and reduce the compliance burden of regulated entities. \\nIn line with the Government of India’s vision towards Financial Inclusion and a strong emphasis \\non accelerating reforms, IRDAI, during FY23, has implemented the following measures to \\nincrease accessibility, innovation, competition, distribution efficiency, and choice availability while \\nmainstreaming technology and moving towards principle-based regime: -\\n i.  easy entry into the insurance sector: A Single Window NOC Portal (www.noc.irdai.gov.in) was \\nlaunched to facilitate the incorporation of an insurer by making the NOC available in a hassle-free \\nand timely manner. \\n ii.  Quick launch of insurance Products: Insurers can now launch all Health & General Insurance \\nproducts, as well as the majority of Life Insurance products, without seeking prior approval from IRDAI, thereby reducing the time taken to launch a new product in the market from a few months \\nto a few days. \\n iii.  ease of doing business:  IRDAI has taken several actions to lessen the burden of compliance. In \\nthis direction, so far, 70 returns have been rationalised, and about 85 circulars have been repealed \\nwhile dispensing with the prior approval requirements in certain identified areas. \\n iv.  Providing further impetus to the industry: Given that the sector has reached a level of maturity \\nthat may not necessitate closer supervision, more flexibility to the regulated entities in the areas of \\noperational and business decisions is being considered. \\n v.  Addressing dynamic needs of the industry:  IRDAI has facilitated various measures as per the evolving needs of the sector, such as Tech-based add-ons (General insurers have been permitted \\nto introduce tech-enabled concepts for Motor Insurance such as  Pay as You Drive, Pay How You \\nDrive, etc.), expansion in the scope of the cashless facility in health insurance, Innovative products \\nin Fire Insurance, Ease of living for Senior Citizen.\\nMajor Services: Sub-Sector-Wise Performance\\ntourism and hotel industry\\n10.10  The post-pandemic scenario of global tourism is gradually converging to the pre-pandemic \\none. With travel restrictions and health concerns subsiding, tourism has become a vital driver of \\na strong upswing in contact-intensive activity. As per the World Tourism Barometer of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (November 2022), international tourism showed robust performance in January-September 2022, with international tourist arrivals reaching 63 per cent of the pre-pandemic level in the first nine months of 2022, boosted by strong pent-up demand, improved confidence levels and the lifting of restrictions. The pace of recovery would have been even stronger but for the lingering global uncertainties and higher inflation in advanced nations. \\n1Until October 2022   \\n2Sigma Report (No 4/2022) by Swiss Re (Page no 15) 298\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n10.11  The Covid-19 pandemic affected the fortunes of the hospitality and tourism industries in \\nrecent years. The hotel industry closed the year 2020 with an average hotel occupancy rate of 33-\\n36 per cent, reflecting a decline of 32 per cent3. In the wake of falling demand and occupancies, \\nhotels reduced tariffs significantly to attract business, thus, pulling down Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) to a dismal low of ₹1,500 - ₹1,800, a decline of around 57-59 per cent. However, hotel occupancy began a strong recovery in the third quarter of 2021\\n4, driven by domestic leisure \\ntravel growth, partial resumption of business travel in the country, as well as wedding and social events. Small-to-medium-sized domestic MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conference, Exhibitions) events also made a comeback, fuelling demand for hotels. The sector ended the year with an average occupancy of 42-45 per cent, up 10-13 percentage points over the previous year. \\n10.12  The reintroduction of travel restrictions across States at the beginning of 2022 due to the \\nemergence of a new Covid-19 strain, Omicron, again threw the Indian hospitality sector into an \\nupheaval. Other leisure and business travel plans were put on hold, barring critical and urgent travel as people exercised caution. The low demand resulted in an average hotel occupancy rate of 50 per cent during January-March 2022. However, due to the lower severity and hospitalisation rate of the Omicron variant, travel demand in India began its return to normalcy in March 2022. Aiding the revival of travel demand was the high vaccination rate in the country, as also effective pandemic management that ensured speed in imposing as well as the lifting of mobility restrictions closely tracking the spread and subsiding of the virus. After a two-year hiatus, India also resumed all regular international flights at full capacity as 2021-22 came to a close. Consequently, the entire aircraft movement (cargo aircraft + passenger aircraft) in the country increased by 52.9 per cent YoY between April and November 2022, reaching 93.9 per cent of the movement recorded between April and November 2019. Presently, the hotel industry is thriving with improvements in occupancy rate, an increase in Average Room Rate (ARR) and a rise in RevPAR\\n5. The occupancy \\nrate in November 2022 stood at around 68-70 per cent, completely recovering the average pre-pandemic level of 2019-20. \\n10.13  Tourism industry was another sector that was adversely impacted by the pandemic. A \\nsignificant decline in Foreign Tourist Arrivals in India was witnessed in FY21. As per a study\\n6 \\nconducted by the Ministry of Tourism in collaboration with the National Council of Applied and \\nEconomic Research (NCAER), Tourism Direct Gross Value Added (TDGV A) witnessed a decline of 42.8 per cent in Q1, 15.5 per cent in Q2, and 1.1 per cent in  Q3 of FY21 due to the overall economic slowdown in FY21. Tourism being a contact-intensive sector, employment in the sector was impacted due to the lockdown, and it was a global phenomenon. 14.5 million direct jobs in Q1, 5.2 million in Q2, and 1.8 million in Q3 are expected to have been lost compared to an estimated 34.8 million direct jobs in the tourism sector in the pre-pandemic period of FY20.\\n10.14  However, with the waning of the pandemic, India’s tourism sector is also showing signs \\nof revival.

The work-from-home model had an impact on the demand \\nfor office space requirements by the corporates. \\n10.18 The Pandemic, however, brought about a change in individual home buyers’ sentiment \\nin favour of owning a house. With the easing of curbs, there was an increase in interest in the \\nresidential housing sector and more so in the readily available and affordable segment. The hybrid work mode with the privileges of working from anywhere encouraged first-time home buyers to move away from the conventional metros, and this brought about a pent-up demand in the residential real estate markets of Tier II and III cities. Improvement in affordability in response to measures taken by the government during the pandemic, such as lower interest rates, reduction in circle rates, and cut in stamp duties on transaction of sale/purchase of immovable property, the extension of the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) also played a significant role in post-pandemic rebound of Real Estate sector.\\nBox X.3: Measures taken by the government to boost the housing sector\\nThe various policy intervention by the government, including ‘Housing for All’, Aatmanirbhar Bharat, etc., provided an impetus to the Housing Finance sector. The permission by RBI to lending institutions to grant a total moratorium of 6 (3+3) months in case of payment failure \\ndue \\nbetween 1st March 2020 to 31st August 2020, infusion of ₹75,000 crore for Non-Banking Financial \\nCorporations (NBFCs), Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) and Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs), \\namong others, have also contributed to the revival of the real estate sector.\\nThe interest subvention under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme \\nUrban) (PMAY-CLSS (U)) has been the demand-side driver in the residential housing space. \\nThis, along with streamlined policies to increase the credit flow, has helped in the creation of a \\nconsumer-friendly ecosystem for housing finance. Since its inception, the government has released \\na subsidy amounting to ₹ 53,548 crore benefitting approximately 22.87 lakh households. Further, \\nthe Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) created sufficient liquidity in the sector for viable growth. Under the Affordable Housing Fund, National Housing Bank has disbursed ₹ 34,588 crore for \\n3.9 lakh dwelling units since its inception. Under the Special Liquidity Facility of RBI, National \\nHousing Bank (NHB) disbursed ₹13,917 crore and ₹8,112 crore during the 1st and 2nd waves of the pandemic, respectively, to ensure seamless business as usual in the sector. Including the \\nabove, National Housing bank has provided Liquidity support of ₹ 88,400 crore through various \\nrefinance schemes since the onset of the Pandemic.\\nThe concessional liquidity provided the sector with the much-needed liquidity influx for keeping the \\nsector resilient. The Co-lending model has been put forward with the aim to leverage the liquidity \\nbase of the banks and reach of HFCs to deliver formal housing credit to the bottom of the pyramid. The Smart City Project, with a plan to build 100 smart cities across India, was aimed at improving the \\noverall opportunity for the real estate sector and encouraging investments. The overall affordability in \\nthe residential real estate sector was high during the post-pandemic period, as reflected by a decline in the weighted average annual interest rate on home loans from 8.6 per cent during January-March 2020 \\nto 7.3 per cent during January-March 2022 for Scheduled Commercial Banks. Also, with a consistent \\nthrust on affordable housing and a series of measures taken by the Government and the Regulators, the sector bounced back, registering a more robust growth with consistent improvement in sales as well as \\nnew launches.302\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n10.19 The geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine have again raised concerns \\nregarding disruption in the global supply chain and its consequent impact on the real estate \\nsector. With a volatile international market, the surge in prices of construction materials has pushed developers to halt ongoing construction. The Wholesale Price Index for Cement, Lime & Plaster has increased from 127.1 in December 2021 to 137.6 during December 2022, indicating an uptick in the input cost for construction. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has further affected the supply chain resulting in price escalations of steel, cement, finishing materials, imported chemicals, and fuel, thereby increasing the overall construction cost and resulting in a rise in housing prices. \\n10.20 Notwithstanding the current impediments, such as rising interest rates on home loans and \\nan increase in property prices, the sector has witnessed resilient growth in the current year, with \\nhousing sales and the launch of new houses in Q2 of FY23 surpassing the pre-pandemic level of Q2 of FY20. There is evidence of a significant decline in the inventory overhang\\n9 dipping to 33 \\nmonths during Q3 of FY23 from 42 months last year. The unsold inventory stood at 8.5 lakh at the end of 2022 with 80 per cent of the stocks under various stages of construction. This comes on the back of sustained sales momentum as the sector steadily recovers from the impact of the pandemic. Going forward, the recent government measures, such as the reduction in import duties on steel products, iron ore, and steel intermediaries, will cool off the construction cost and help to check the rise in housing prices.\\nfigure X.9: Sustained growth in housing \\nsales and launches, surpassing the  \\npre-pandemic levelfigure X.10: the decline in  \\ninventory overhang\\n 04080120160\\nQ1\\nQ2Q3\\nQ4\\nQ1Q2\\nQ3\\nQ4Q1\\nQ2\\nQ3Q4Q1\\nQ2\\nQ3\\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23Thousand  New launches Sales\\n 0102030405060\\n0246810\\nQ1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3\\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-\\n23\\nPer cent  Lakh  Unsold Inventory\\nInventory Overhang (RHS)\\nSource: Prop Tiger\\n10.21 According to JLL’s 2022 Global Real Estate Transparency Index10 11, India’s real estate \\nmarket transparency is among the top ten most improved markets globally, with its composite \\n9Inventory overhang refers to the estimated time period developers are likely to take to sell off the unsold inventory, based on the current sales  \\n velocity.\\n10The Global Real Estate Transparency Index is based on a combination of quantitative market data and survey results across 94 countries  \\n  and 156 city markets.

With rapid digitisation across the value chain, end-user industries are primed to adopt holistic and high-end enterprise performance solutions in an evolutionary journey over the near to long term.\\n10.23 According to NASSCOM’s report\\n12, India’s IT-BPM industry has been exceptionally \\nresilient during the pandemic, driven by increased technology spending, accelerated technology \\nadoption, and digital transformation. This is evident in the swift and wide-scale remote working adoption of one of the world’s largest IT workforces. Capitalising on the learnings from the first wave, the industry’s response to the second wave has moved beyond addressing the immediate challenges to significantly enhancing capabilities to become a future-ready organisation. An obsession with customer-centricity, domain-specific solutions, a digital-first talent pool, and a laser-sharp focus on creating future-ready solutions have been the key pillars that enabled technology firms to respond proactively to emerging customer demand throughout the pandemic.\\n10.24  IT-BPM revenues registered YoY growth of 15.5 per cent during FY22 compared to 2.1 \\nper cent growth in FY21, with all sub-sectors showing double-digit revenue growth. Within the IT-\\nBPM sector, IT services constitute the majority share (greater than 51 per cent). Exports (including hardware) witnessed a growth of 17.2 per cent in FY22 compared to 1.9 per cent growth in FY21, owing to the increased reliance of businesses on technology, the roll-out of cost-reducing deals\\n13  \\n12 https://nasscom.in/knowledge-center /publications/technology-sector-india-2022-strategic-review\\n13  Cost-reducing deals refer to business deals which result in a decline in the company’s expenses to maximise profits.

Many firms are now focusing on new markets, more prominently the Middle East and Latin America leading to market diversification which will increase the IT-BPM sector’s resilience in the coming years. The industry recorded nearly 10 per cent estimated growth in direct employee pool in FY22 with a highest-ever net addition to its employee base. The domestic technology industry is estimated to grow at 10 per cent on account of enterprise digital acceleration and transformation. \\nfigure X.12: geographic distribution of \\nit-BPM exports (excluding hardware)figure X.13: Segment-wise break-up \\nof revenues in fY22\\n \\n62% 17% 11% 8% 2% \\nUSA\\n UK\\nEurope (excl.

However, NASSCOM’s quarterly review in August 2022 indicates that technology spending during FY23 is likely to see a relatively muted growth dampened by an expected global slowdown.\\nBox X.4: Major growth drivers in the it -BPM industry\\n•   increasing penetration of digital tech and “Made in india digital-first solutions for the \\nworld.” \\nIn India, the proportion of digital revenue as a percentage of total revenue has increased from around 26-28 per cent in FY20 to 30-32 per cent in FY22. In recent years, India has emerged as a global powerhouse for Engineering R&D (ER&D) and innovation and is steadfastly committed to ushering future growth and innovation for global enterprises. Many Global Competency Centres (GCCs) have been incorporated in India in the last six years. GCCs in India are increasingly performing complex R&D functions and are leveraging futuristic technologies and developing digitally innovative products as well building either the largest or the second-largest ER&D hubs in India. Patent filing has increased drastically, with over 138,000 patents filed between 2015- 21, with over 85,000 filed in emerging technologies. 305\\nServices: Source of Strength\\n•  Margin defence through operational excellence  \\nMargin defence has been the critical focus amidst supply challenges as growing demand for \\ntech talent puts pressure on margins with a limited opportunity to pass on the cost increase. Key margin levers include increased capacity utilisation, a higher share of offshore revenue, a declining share of travel and facility costs, and operating leverage.\\n•  india is a digital talent nation \\nIndia has emerged as a digital talent nation with a high share of the working population and growing undergraduate enrolments. Employment across technology companies witnessed an increase, with an uptrend in the digital talent base. New talent hiring from tier-2 cities, with a focus on reskilling non-tech talent, has led India to evolve as a significant sub-contractor base, with more women gett ing back into the workforce.\\n•  Leading in hybrid work models \\nIndian tech industry led the adoption of hybrid work models. The technology used for \\naugmenting employee experience and integrating tech solutions in aspects such as employee onboarding, communication, collaboration, and employee well-being & enablement has \\nbeen the major driver. The HR functions at organisations are undergoing a transformation journey; the organisations are moving forward with an objective to deliver cost savings while expanding services and improving experiences by using a combination of labour arbitrage, optimised workforce models, elimination of low-value vendor spends, increasing talent liquidity and reducing people space cost.\\ne-commerce\\n10.26 On the same lines as the IT-BPM sector, the E-Commerce sector also witnessed a \\nrenewed push and a sharp increase in penetration in the aftermath of the pandemic. Lockdowns \\nand mobility restrictions disrupted consumer behaviour and gave an impetus to online shopping. The Government’s push to boost the digital economy, growing internet penetration, rise in smartphone adoption, innovation in mobile technologies, and increased adoption of digital payments further accelerated the adoption and growth of e-commerce. According to the Global Payments Report by Worldpay FIS, India’s e-commerce market is projected to post impressive gains and grow at 18 per cent annually through 2025.\\n10.27  The expansion of e-commerce to newer segments like grocery, fresh-to-home fruits and \\nvegetables, and general merchandise has contributed to the expansion of the customer base beyond \\ntraditional buyers. And as per the latest report ‘How India Shops Online 2022’ by Bain & Company, emerging categories – fashion, grocery, general merchandise – would shore up e-commerce growth in India and would capture nearly two-thirds of the Indian e-commerce market by 2027.\\n10.28 There has also been an increase in the adoption of digital solutions by Micro, Small and \\nMedium Enterprises (MSMEs) like e-commerce and e-procurement, realising the prospects of \\nincreased revenues and margins, improved market reach, access to new markets, and customer acquisition. A recent study by IIFT analysing the impact of the interaction between MSMEs and e-commerce found that in recent years, MSMEs that adopted digital solutions fared far better than offline MSMEs, assisting them in accessing a large marketplace without incurring huge costs. The E-commerce platform has not only empowered small businesses by removing geographical barriers and providing a large customer base but also allowed them to deal directly 306\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nwith manufacturers and suppliers, thus reducing the cost of procurement. This increased access \\nto suppliers significantly helps small business owners scale up their businesses at a much lower investment level, thus boosting their cost structure.\\n10.29 Further, there has been a phenomenal geographical expansion with the growth of \\ne-commerce business in rural India driven by increased smartphone penetration, internet \\nadoption, and increased purchasing power of rural customers. In addition, fiscal support during the pandemic helped boost e-commerce penetration in rural areas, likely by increasing consumption, which could mostly be done online in the presence of pandemic restrictions. A vast untapped rural market holds the potential for strengthening consumption growth; new E-commerce companies like Trell, Meesho, and shop 101, are expanding and gaining popularity in Tier 3 and 4 cities. The E-commerce industry is focusing on local solutions to penetrate rural areas by strengthening the network of rural distributors and retailers and using local distribution centres as Pick Up Drop Off points, enabling logistics companies to serve rural consumers.\\nfigure X.14: fashion, grocery, and general merchandise to capture \\nnearly two-thirds of the indian e-commerce market by 2027     \\n Mobiles/E\\nlectronics/\\nAppliance\\ns (25% -\\n30%)  \\nFashion \\n(25% -\\n30%) Grocery/G\\neneral \\nMerchandi\\nse (30% -\\n35%) Other \\n(10% -\\n15%) \\n2027 \\n Mobiles/\\nElectronic\\ns/Applian\\nces (45% -\\n50%)  \\nFashion \\n(20% -\\n25%)  Grocery/G\\neneral \\nMerchandi\\nse (20% -\\n25%)  Other \\n(5%-\\n10%)  \\n2022 \\nSource: How India Shops Online 2022, Bain and Company\\n10.30 In terms of order volume and valuation, post-Covid-19 years have been the most \\nsuccessful years for Indian E-commerce start-ups. As per the Retail and E-commerce Trends report released by Unicommerce and Wazir Advisors\\n14, overall e-commerce order volume \\nwitnessed a growth of 69.4 per cent YoY in FY22, driven mainly by consumers from tier-II and tier-III cities in the last two years. The shoppers from tier-II and tier-III cities accounted for over 61.3 per cent of the overall market share in FY22, increasing from 53.8 per cent in FY21. The order volume from tier-II and tier-III cities grew at almost double the pace of tier-I cities, with 92.2 per cent and 85.2 per cent YoY growth, respectively, in FY22. In contrast, tier-I cities indicated a comparatively slower order volume growth rate of 47.2 per cent.\\n10.31 The Government E-Marketplace (GeM) has also witnessed tremendous growth in \\nGross Merchandise Value (GMV) and is catching up with E-commerce giants like Amazon and \\n14 https://retail.economictimes.india times.com/files/cp/1294/cdoc-1661333692-ECOM_july_7_5in%20x%208in_Correction.pdf307\\nServices: Source of Strength\\nFlipkart. GeM attained an annual procurement of ₹1 lakh crore within FY22, representing a \\n160 per cent growth compared to last FY . GeM has taken a host of steps to onboard products of Self-Help Groups (SHGs), tribal communities, artisans, weavers, and MSMEs. 57 per cent of the total business on GeM has come through the MSME units, and female entrepreneurs have contributed over 6 per cent.\\n10.32 Initiatives taken by the Government for the promotion of e-Commerce, including the \\nDigital India program, Unified Payment Interface (UPI), GeM, etc., have been major contributory \\nfactors to the growth of E-commerce in recent years. Various initiatives have also been taken to provide an opportunity to small retailers, manufacturers, and Self-Help Groups for greater outreach. One District – One Product (ODOP) initiative has been facilitating the onboarding of sellers of identified products on e-Commerce platforms to provide greater visibility for small businesses from the rural sector. E-marketplace www.tribesindia.com portal through Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (TRIFED) has been onboarding tribal artisans with their products for online sales, ensuring tribal products find a larger audience in the international market as well. \\n10.33 The recent initiative of the launch of Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) \\nis also playing a significant role in democratising digital payments, enabling interoperability, \\nand bringing down transaction costs. ONDC provides better market access to sellers and helps bring the country\\'s remotest corners into the e-Commerce framework by empowering them with digitisation.

With a strong foundation provided by the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity, UPI, and other regulatory frameworks, the pandemic has aided acceleration in digital adoption and provided a fillip to digital financial services solutions by banks, NBFCs, insurers as well as fintech. The pandemic provided the opportunity for fintech companies to reach the underserved and provide cost-effective financial services to those at the bottom of the pyramid. While globally, the technological solutions cushioned the reverberations of the pandemic, India took the lead with the fintech adoption rate of 87 per cent, substantially higher than the world average of 64 per cent as per the latest Global FinTech Adoption Index\\n15.\\n10.35 Over the last few years, the number of neobanking platforms and global investments \\nin the neo-banking segment has also risen consistently. Neobanks operate under mainstream finance\\'s umbrella but empower specific services long associated with traditional institutions such as banks, payment providers, etc. Neobanks operate entirely online, with no physical presence apart from office space in the offline world. The growth of these institutions is spurred by the need for on-demand and easier-to-access financial solutions by a young and increasingly digitally savvy demographic. Neobanks have eased availability and provided access to financial services to MSMEs and underbanked customers and areas. The government also, through various \\n15 https://assets.ey.com/content/dam /ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/banking-and-capital-markets/ey-global-fintech-adoption-index.pdf308\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\ninitiatives, has given a push to digital banking solutions. 75 Digital Banking Units (DBU) across \\n75 districts announced in Union Budget 2022-23 to take banking solutions to every nook and corner of the country have been launched.\\n10.36 The introduction of CBDC will also significantly boost digital financial services. Issuance \\nof CBDC in India offers several benefits, which inter alia, include reduction in operational \\ncosts involved in physical cash management, fostering financial inclusion, bringing resilience, efficiency, and innovation in the payments system, boosting innovation in cross-border payments space, and providing public with uses that any private virtual currencies can provide, without the associated risks. As of July 2022, there are 105 countries in the process of exploring CBDC, a number that covers 95 per cent of the global GDP. Many countries have already launched the CBDC, while others are in the pilot stage. \\n10.37 RBI has also recently launched pilots of CBDC in both the Wholesale and Retail segments. \\nDigital Rupee –Wholesale- the pilot in the wholesale segment was launched on 1st November \\n2022, with the use case being limited to the settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities. Use of Digital Rupee- Wholesale is expected to make the inter-bank market more efficient. The pilot in the retail segment, known as Digital Rupee-Retail kicked off on 1st December 2022, within a closed user group comprising participating customers and merchants. For full operationalisation of CBDC, RBI is gradually expanding the pilots\\' scope to include more banks, users, and locations based on feedback received during the pilots.\\n10.38 Digitalising documents has also played a pivotal role in giving further impetus to digital \\nfinancial services. The digitisation of documents ensures safety, online verification, improved \\naccessibility, and fraud reduction, enhancing use for end customers and the service provider.\\nBox X.5: Account Aggregator framework:  \\ntransforming india’s financial Services\\nAccount Aggregator (AA) is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) engaged in the \\nbusiness of providing the service of retrieving or collecting financial information pertaining \\nto the customer.

This was done at the behest of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India and with \\nthe support of the Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance. \\nThe core principle of the NeSL-DDE platform is to digitise all the steps of the document/\\nagreement execution journey. These include: -\\n• Submission of information and document/agreement to be executed on the platform\\n• Flexibility to accommodate any agreement/document format\\n• Consent-based process\\n• Digital payment of stamp duty and affixing of digital e-stamp certificate\\n• Verification of the identity of the executants and digital execution using an electronic  \\n\\u2003\\u2003 signature• Secure storage transmission and retrieval of the digitally executed document generated  \\n\\u2003\\u2003 using the platform\\nThe NeSL-DDE platform eliminates the need for the physical presence of the executants and \\nthe manual process to be carried out for executing documents/agreements. By doing so, the platform generates several benefits, such as lower execution time and cost, a secure system, authorised access, bulk processing, fraud prevention, legal robustness, and evidentiary value. A significant enabler in the journey of digitisation of documents/agreements in the financial sector is the use of the Aadhaar e-Sign, which has made electronic signatures widely available to citizens at a nominal cost.\\nThe NeSL-DDE platform has garnered the support of state governments, ministries, and \\nfinancial institutions. DFS has been encouraging banks to consider adopting DDE for their agreements. Currently, 23 States and Union Territories are available for digital e-stamping on the NeSL DDE platform. 27 banks and NBFCs are using the platform for executing their agreements, and so far, more than 9 lakh transactions have been undertaken. This includes small-ticket consumer lending transactions to large-value corporate lending transactions. 310\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nOne use case of the NeSL-DDE platform is the electronic bank guarantee (e-BG), which takes \\naway all the issues and challenges associated with the issuance, transfer, and management of physical bank guarantees and brings inefficiencies of time and cost savings. As the adoption of e-BG picks up, the NeSL platform can also function as a central repository of bank guarantees. Recently, the Department of Expenditure has amended the General Financial Rules, 2017, to permit the acceptance of e-BG in the government procurement process.  \\nWhile the initial use case of NeSL-DDE is financial documents/agreements, the platform \\nshall also enable the digital execution of other documents/agreements. This secure, paperless, hassle-free contracting offered by NeSL-DDE will have significant implications on the ease of doing business in the nation.\\noutlook\\n10.39 India’s services sector growth which was highly volatile and fragile during the last \\n2 fiscal years, has shown resilience in FY23 driven by the release of pent-up demand, ease of mobility restriction, near-universal vaccination coverage and pre-emptive government interventions. Broad-based recovery has been observed in recent months, with pick up in almost all sub-sectors especially contact intensive services sector, which bore the maximum brunt of the pandemic. This is reflective of an uptick in the performance of various HFIs, reflecting a solid upswing in recent months, hinting at an enhanced presentation of the services sector in the next fiscal. The prospects look bright with improved performance of various sub-sectors like Tourism, Hotel, Real estate, IT-BPM, E-commerce etc. The downside risk, however, lies in the external exogenous factors and bleak economic outlook in Advanced Economies impacting growth prospects of the services sector through trade and other linkages. CHAPTER11\\nIndia’ s external sector has been buffeted by shocks and uncertainty manifested in terms of \\nelevated, though now easing global commodity prices; tightening international financial \\nconditions; heightening financial market volatility; reversal of capital flows; currency \\ndepreciation, and looming global growth and trade slowdown. However, it has been able to face these headwinds from a position of strength on the back of strong macroeconomic \\nfundamentals and buffers.\\nDuring FY23 (till December 2022) India’ s exports have displayed resilience on the back \\nof record levels of exports in FY22. Petroleum products, gems & jewellery, organic & \\ninorganic chemicals, drugs & pharmaceuticals were among the leading export items. \\nHowever, the slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economy characterised by slowing global trade. Recognising the key role exports play in improving \\nthe resilience of the external sector, from a medium to long-term perspective, various \\nexport promotion measures are being considered/implemented. These measures would nurture the inherent comparative advantage that Indian exports embody. In addition, \\nwhile National Logistics Policy would ease the domestic frictions to encourage Indian \\nexports by reducing the cost of internal logistics, the latest Free Trade Agreements, such as with UAE and Australia, would address the external frictions by creating opportunities \\nfor exports at concessional tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Thus, the whole ecosystem \\nwould evolve in an export-friendly manner over time. \\nApart from the elevated crude oil prices, the revival of economic activity contributed \\nto an increase in imports. Petroleum, crude & products; electronic goods; coal, coke \\n& briquettes, etc.; machinery, electrical & non-electrical and gold were among the top import items. While the continued softening of the global commodity price outlook would \\nassist moderate imports going forward, non-gold, non-oil imports may not decelerate \\nsignificantly. Further, efforts are underway to promote international trade settlement in Indian Rupees. Once these initiatives gain traction, dependence on foreign currency \\nwould potentially reduce, making the economy less vulnerable to external shocks.  \\nBalance of Payments (BoP) encountered pressures during the year under review. While \\nthe impact of a sharp rise in oil prices was discernible in the widening of the Current \\nAccount Deficit (CAD), notwithstanding the cushion provided by the surplus on Invisibles \\n(services, transfer, and income), policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve and the strengthening of the US dollar led to Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) outflows. As a \\nresult, the surplus of the capital account was lower than the CAD leading to a depletion \\nof forex reserves on a BoP basis.

Following the global \\nfinancial crisis in 2007-08 as the inflationary pressures were muted, interest rates were extremely low for long years. The easing financial conditions supported global economic growth, which reached 4.5 per cent in 2010. Now, the Covid-19 pandemic is another shock to global growth performance, with economic growth down to a negative of 3.8 per cent in 2020. The following two years saw inflation rates rise to multi-decade highs, fuelled by global commodity and food price spikes. The situation has been further amplified by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. To stem the situation, monetary authorities in advanced economies, especially the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), are accelerating the pace of monetary policy normalisation. The 10-year Treasury yield in the US increased almost six-fold between mid-2020 and mid-2022. Risk assets were sold off sharply triggering capital flight from many emerging and frontier market economies, bringing to a halt the rebound of net capital flows to developing countries observed since the last quarter of 2020. \\n11.2 Interest rates and prices of risk assets have been extremely volatile since April 2022, \\nreflecting heightened uncertainty about the economic and policy outlook, exacerbated by low \\nliquidity. The US dollar appreciated sharply against currencies of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and major advanced economies facing high borrowing costs. Thus, global financial conditions have considerably tightened especially since April 2022, and the balance of risks is significantly skewed to the downside, thereby weakening the global economic outlook. Global growth is forecast to slow from 6.0 per cent in 2021 to 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.7 per cent in 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\\n1 This is the weakest growth profile \\nsince 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the pandemic. Further, external public debt vulnerability concerns are being exacerbated as such debt in developing economies is at record levels presently and most of it is owed to private creditors, with much of it involving variable interest rates that could spike suddenly.\\n2 Thus, emerging markets face a \\nhost of risks emanating from elevated external borrowing costs, sticky high inflation, volatile commodity markets, uncertain global economic growth outlook, and spill overs from policy tightening in advanced economies.\\n1World Economic Outlook Report, IMF, October 2022.\\n2“South Asia’s Current Macroeconomic Challenges and Policy Priorities”, Keynote Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, Reserve Bank \\nof India –6 January  2023 - at the high-level Conference co-organised by IMF Asia and Pacific Department and IMF South Asia Regional \\nTraining and Technical Assistance Centre, New Delhiprices, the resilience of net services exports and buoyant inward remittances would result \\nin lower CAD during the remainder of FY23 and is expected to be within sustainable \\nlimits. \\nThe fortified shock absorbers of India’ s external sector are in place to cushion the global \\nheadwinds be it the formidable forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, or \\nmarket-determined exchange rate. While forex reserves as of the end December 2022 \\nstood at US$ 562.72 billion, accounting for 9.3 months of imports, the ratio of external debt to GDP is at a comfortable level of 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022.313\\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\\n11.3 Against this fast-evolving global backdrop, this chapter chronicles the developments in the \\nexternal sector of the Indian economy focusing on exports, imports, international investment, \\nforeign exchange reserves, movement of the currency against the US dollar, external debt, and the BoP situation. Where available, a comparison of some of these indicators with some peer countries is also made to present India’s external sector situation in a proper perspective. \\ntrade helping India reap the Benefits of Globalised world\\n11.4 In the present globalised and integrated world, trade is essential for developing countries \\nto reap the benefit of increased globalisation of products and financial markets. It is well recognised that trade is not an end in itself but a means to balanced, equitable, and sustainable development. Conventional economic theories point towards potential gains that could emerge from openness to international trade and investment.\\n11.5 Over time, the trade openness of countries across the globe has been increasing as measured \\nby trade as a proportion of GDP. For the world as a whole, the share of trade as a percentage of \\nworld GDP\\n3 has been in the range of 50-60 per cent since 2003 and stood at 52 per cent in 2020, \\naccording to the World Bank database. For India as well, the share of trade as a percentage of GDP has been steadily increasing, being above 40 per cent since 2005 (except 2020 being the pandemic year). The ratio stands at 46 per cent in 2021 and 50 per cent for H1 of 2022.\\nGlobal Scenario\\n11.6 Post Covid-19-induced disruptions, global trade prospects have improved in FY22. Global \\ntrade exhibited resilience in the first half (H1) of 2022, notwithstanding the headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Robust merchandise imports – emerging primarily from Europe, the United States, and parts of the developing world supported the growth of merchandise trade in H12022. This partially reflected pent-up demand relating to the legacy of the pandemic-driven spending shift from services towards goods that were constrained earlier because of the supply bottlenecks. Other factors contributing to the trend were the appreciation of the dollar in the case of the United States, the relative dynamism of intra-regional trade in Europe, and favourable terms-of-trade effects in some large emerging economies due to elevated energy prices.\\n4 The \\nglobal trade volume grew by 4.8 per cent in H12022, on top of an impressive recovery of 9.7 per cent in 2021, as per the World Trade Organisation (WTO) statistics. The global merchandise trade in value terms rose year-on-year (YoY), by 22.2 per cent in 2021, reversing the deceleration observed in the previous three years. During the H1 of 2022, the trade-in value terms grew by 32 per cent compared to the corresponding period of 2019.\\n5 \\n11.7 However, the global trade outlook turned grimmer in the second half (H2) of 2022 on the \\nback of a confluence of adverse factors including the increasing likelihood of a recession in the major economies and the tapering demand for consumer durables; aggressive monetary policy tightening by several central banks; disorderly financial conditions; continued supply-chain disruptions and elevated freight charges. The leading indicators of global trade viz., inventories \\n3Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of GDP. \\n4UNCTAD, Trade and Development Report 2022, Development prospects in a fractured world: Global disorder and regional responses, October \\n2022.\\n5WTO’s press release, International Trade Statistics, 5 October 2022.314\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nand new export orders seem to bear testimony to these adverse events. Trade growth is likely \\nto slow in the closing months of 2022 and into 2023, according to the WTO Goods Trade Barometer\\n6 released on 28 November 2022, as the global economy continues to be buffeted by \\nstrong headwinds. The current reading of 96.2 is below both the baseline value for the index and the previous reading of 100.0, reflecting the slowdown in demand for traded goods.\\n11.8 Thus, as regards the future trade projections, according to the WTO, world trade is expected \\nto lose momentum in H2-2022 and remain subdued in 2023. The organisation forecasts global \\ntrade to grow in 2023 by just 1 per cent, a sharp downward revision from the previous estimate of 3.4 per cent\\n7. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the forecast due \\nto shifting monetary policy in advanced economies and the unpredictable nature of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in its Global Trade update of December 2022 has also noted that the ongoing trade slowdown is expected to worsen for 2023 and further that while the outlook for global trade remains uncertain, negative factors appear to outweigh positive trends.\\nfigure xI.1: Growth in Global Merchandise trade: actual and forecast\\n19.5 19.017.622.2\\n3.4\\n0.5\\n-5.69.7\\n3.51.03.0\\n3.4\\n-10-50510152025\\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023Value US$ trillion / Volume percent change (Y -o-Y)\\nValue (US$ trillion) Volume Volume Forecast (Oct 2022) Volume Forecast (April 2022)\\nSource: WTO\\nIndia’s growing and diversifying trade\\n11.9 International trade has been an important pillar of the resilience of India’s external sector. \\nTrade as a percentage of GDP for India was in the range of 12-15 per cent in the 1980s; 16-25 \\nper cent in the 1990s and 25-50 per cent in the 2000s.

Merchandise exports were US$ 332.8 billion over April-December 2022 against US$ 305.0 billion during the period April-December 2021. Non-petroleum and non-gems & jewellery exports in April-December 2022 were US$ 233.5 billion, as compared to US$ 230.0 billion in April-December 2021. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) exports constituted about 21.1 per cent and non-POL exports were 78.9 per cent of total exports during FY23 (until December 2022). Owing to the rise in global crude oil prices, petroleum products continued to be the most exported commodity in FY22 and April-December, 2022, followed by gems and jewellery, organic & inorganic chemicals, and drugs & pharmaceuticals (Tables 6.3A & B of Statistical Appendix).\\nfigure xI.3: India’s Merchandise Exports5\\n7\\n5\\n8\\n13\\n16\\n18\\n21\\n27\\n24\\n1947\\n67\\n70\\n82\\n83\\n87\\n89\\n96\\n94\\n87\\n82\\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3\\n2020 -21 2021 -22 2022 -23 (P)POL Exports Non POL ExportsUS$ Billion\\nSource: Department of Commerce   Note: P: Provisional\\nBright spots in India’s trade performance\\n11.11 Significant strides in exports were registered in drugs and pharmaceutical, electronic \\ngoods, engineering goods and organic and inorganic chemicals sectors in FY22. These sectors have sustained their growth momentum despite the global headwinds in H1FY23. India’s pharma exports grew despite Covid impacted disruptions in supply chain increasing significantly from US$ 15.4 billion in FY15 to US$ 24.6 billion in FY22 and stood at US$ 18.8 billion during April-December 2022, registering a positive growth of 3.6 per cent over April- December 2021. The high growth in export was on account of the stocking of inventories of medicines by countries all over the world, and increased demand for vaccines and medicines related to the Covid-19 pandemic which India was in a position to provide. India has also been seeing consistent growth in exports of electronic goods. Electronic goods exports which remained below US$ 10 billion till FY19, have shown an increase of 51.6 per cent from US$ 11.0 billion during April-December 317\\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\\n2021 to US$ 16.7 billion during April-December. 2022.

Merchandise imports for the period April-December 2022 were US$ 551.7 \\nbillion as against US$ 441.5 billion during the period April-December 2021. Among major import commodities, petroleum crude & products imports increased by 45.6 per cent to US$ 163.9 billion in April-December 2022 compared to US$ 112.6 billion in April-December 2021 and continue to be the highest imported commodity.\\n11.13 Energy demand may be pushing India’s imports for fuel including coal and Petroleum, Oil \\n& Lubricants (POL), whose share rose to 37.1 per cent in total imports in April-December 2022 \\nagainst 30.4 per cent in the corresponding period last year.

The Netherlands has displaced China from the 3rd spot as India\\'s exporting \\npartner. India has diversified its export destinations over time. For example, the share of South Africa in total exports has risen from 1.2 per cent in FY19 to 2.0 per cent in FY23 (April to November). Over the same period, the share of Brazil has increased from 1.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent and that of Saudi Arabia from 1.7 per cent to 2.3 per cent. As regards imports, China, UAE, USA, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have a joint share of 40 per cent of the total imports of India. However, the share of China declined to 13.8 per cent during April-November 2022 from 15.5 per cent a year ago. Similarly, the share of the USA declined to 6.9 per cent in April-November 2022 from 7.2 per cent a year ago (Refer to Table 6.4 in Statistical Appendix).\\nTrade in Services\\n11.16 India maintained its dominance in the world services trade in FY22.  Despite pandemic-\\ninduced global restrictions and weak tourism revenues, India’s services exports stood at US$ 254.5 billion in FY22 recording a growth of 23.5 per cent over FY21 and registered a growth of 32.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period of FY22. Software and business services together constitute more than 60 per cent of India’s total services exports and exhibited strong growth during Q2FY23. While strong revenues in major information technology (IT) companies from various segments such as retail and consumer business; communications and media; healthcare; and banking, financial and insurance services drove the growth in software exports, a significant pick-up in engineering, and research and development related services boosted the growth in business services exports during the quarter. \\n11.17 Services imports rose by 25.1 per cent between FY22 and FY21 to reach US$ 147.0 billion \\nand have registered growth of 36.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period of \\nFY22. The increase in services imports is mainly on account of payments for transport services, travel and other business services. Following the resumption of global activity, shortages of 319\\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\\nshipping vessels and high transportation costs resulted in a spike in transport payments.

Since India offers low-cost knowledge-based services, the demand for them has not fallen even amid a global economic slowdown and a negative outlook for the near future. The estimated value of services export for April-December 2022 is US$ 235.8 billion as against a value of US$ 184.7 billion in April- December 2021. The estimated value of services imports for April- December 2022 is US$ 135.0 billion compared to US$ 105.5 billion in the corresponding period last year.  Supported by the services sector, India\\'s overall exports (Merchandise and Services combined) in April-December 2022 are estimated to be US$ 568.6 billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 16.1 per cent over the same period last year. Overall imports in April-December 2022 are estimated to be US$ 686.7 billion, displaying a positive growth of 25.6 per cent over the same period last year.\\nforeign t rade policy\\n11.19 India’s Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) has, conventionally, been formulated for five years \\nat a time. The focus of the FTP has been to provide a framework of rules and procedures for exports and imports and a set of incentives for promoting exports. The latest FTP for 2015- 2020 is in vogue at present. To provide policy stability during the pandemic period, the five-year FTP 2015-20 was extended from 2020 to 2022. The policy has been further extended till March 2023 on account of volatile global economic and geopolitical situations and currency fluctuations. During this period, the Government has been taking significant measures and consistently looking into opportunities to diversify the exports both in terms of products as well as potential markets. The Government is actively working on facilitating trade agreements and launching schemes in consultation with various stakeholders. In the year 2022, India signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with UAE and with Australia. This aims to provide greater market access with a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services and make the exporters competitive. The Export Preparedness Index\\n8 has also been introduced to evaluate \\nStates’ potentials and capacities. It will guide all stakeholders towards strengthening the export ecosystem at both the national and sub-national levels. \\nInternational trade Settlement in Indian rupees\\n11.20 In July 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular permitting an additional \\narrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR) to promote the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India and to support the increasing interest in the global trading community in INR as an international currency. The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchange rates between the currencies of the trading partner countries, and settlement through special Rupee V ostro\\n9 accounts opened with authorised dealer banks in India.\\n11.21 Under this arrangement for settlement, (a) Indian importers undertaking imports through \\n8NITI Aayog in partnership with the Institute of Competitiveness has prepared an Export Preparedness Index to identify challenges and oppor -\\ntunities; enhance the effectiveness of government policies; and encourage a facilitative regulatory framework. The structure of the EPI includes \\n4 pillars –Policy; Business Ecosystem; Export Ecosystem; Export Performance – and 11 sub-pillars –Export Promotion Policy; Institutional Framework; Business Environment; Infrastructure; Transport Connectivity; Access to Finance; Export Infrastructure; Trade Support; R&D Infrastructure; Export Diversification; and Growth Orientation.\\n9A V ostro account is an account that a domestic bank holds for a foreign bank in the domestic bank’s currency, i.e., Rupee. Such accounts enable \\ndomestic banks to provide international banking services to their clients who have global banking needs.321\\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\\nthis mechanism shall make payment in INR which shall be credited into the Special V ostro \\naccount of the correspondent bank of the partner country, against the invoices for the supply of goods or services from the overseas seller /supplier, while (b) Indian exporters, undertaking exports of goods and services through this mechanism, shall be paid the export proceeds in INR from the balances in the designated Special V ostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country.\\n11.22 The above-mentioned framework for international settlement in INR acquires significance \\nagainst the backdrop of the US Fed aggressively hiking the policy rates and its hawkish stand, \\nthe consequent rallying of the US dollar to multi-decade high levels, and concomitant weakening of currencies of various EMEs including the INR. The framework could largely reduce the net demand for foreign exchange, the US dollar in particular, for the settlement of current account-related trade flows. Further, the use of INR in cross-border trade is expected to mitigate currency risk for Indian businesses. Protection from currency volatility not only reduces the cost of doing business but also enables better business growth, improving the chances for Indian businesses to grow globally. It also reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves and dependence on foreign currency, making Indian economy less vulnerable to external shocks.\\n10 Further, it \\ncould assist Indian exporters in getting advance payments in INR from overseas clients and in the longer term promote INR as an international currency once the rupee settlement mechanism gains traction. One of the prerequisites for the emergence of an international currency is that the said currency needs to be increasingly used for trade invoicing. In terms of foreign exchange market turnover (daily averages), as per the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022, the US dollar is the dominant vehicle currency accounting for 88 per cent of the global forex turnover. The INR accounted for 1.6 per cent. If the INR turnover rises to equal the share of non-US, non-Euro currencies in global forex turnover of 4 per cent, INR could be regarded as an international currency, reflecting India’s position in the global economy.\\n11\\nInitiatives to enhance trade \\n11.23 The commendable performance of India’s exports, standing at US$ 422.0 billion in FY22, \\nexceeding the target of US$ 400 billion, has been the culmination of efforts from all quarters and across stakeholders. Some of the factors leading to the achievement of this target were putting in place of targets by the Government, including the setting of specific targets - country-wise, product-wise, and Export Promotion Council-wise; monitoring of the targets and course correction where required. The export growth was driven by an increase in demand for products like petroleum, cotton yarn, textiles, chemicals, and engineering goods. India was able to leverage the gap in the supply of certain products in the wake of the pandemic-related disruptions and meet the global demand. Exports were also helped by favourable global commodity prices. Some of the specific schemes of the Government which have and are facilitating and encouraging exports are as follows.\\n11.24 focus on agricultural products: India’s agricultural exports achieved the highest ever \\nexport in FY22 reaching US$ 37.8 billion and it continued to perform well in FY23 with exports \\n10Keynote address delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor, RBI at the Annual Day event of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Associa-\\ntion of India (FEDAI) on 20 October 2022 in Mumbai.\\n11Patra, M.

Regular promotions were organised for agricultural products through participation in trade fairs and special events in association with the Indian Missions.\\nTo initiate agriculture exports from UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, APEDA has linked \\nKashmir valley start-ups, new entrepreneurs, Farmer Producer Organisations/farmer groups, and exporters of the region with importers. Regular shipments of high-value Kashmir Saffron (GI) are taking place to destinations including the Middle East, EU, and North America. \\n11.25 Interest Equalisation Scheme: This Scheme was formulated to give benefit in the \\ninterest rates being charged by the banks to the exporters on their pre- and post-shipment rupee \\nexport credits.  While extending the scheme, from 1 October 2021 onwards, subvention rates have also been reduced. Henceforth, reduced revised rates of 3 per cent (erstwhile 5 per cent) subvention to MSME manufacturing exporters and 2 per cent (erstwhile 3 per cent) applies to merchant and other manufacturer exporters exporting along 410 (erstwhile 416) HS lines. \\n11.26 remission of duties and taxes on Exported products (rodtEp) scheme: The scheme \\nseeks remission of Central, State and Local duties/taxes/levies at different stages at the Central, \\nState, and local level, which are incurred in the process of manufacturing and distribution of exported products, but are currently not being refunded under any other duty remission scheme.\\n11.27 Export credit Guarantee: The Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) supports \\nIndian exporters and banks by providing export credit insurance services. ECGC provides insurance \\ncover on the export consignment to protect exporters from the consequences of the payment risks. It also provides Export Credit Insurance to Banks (ECIB) to protect the Banks from losses on account of export credit given to exporters due to the risks of insolvency and/or protracted default of the exporter borrower. The ECGC has launched a new scheme in  July 2022, under its ECIB products. Under this scheme the insurance cover to banks providing pre-shipment and post-shipment finance has been enhanced to 90 per cent from an average coverage of 70 per cent for accounts with an export working capital limit of up to X20 crore to support small exporters. \\n11.28 Krishi udan Scheme: Krishi Udan Scheme was launched in August 2020 on international \\nand national routes to assist farmers in transporting agricultural products so that it improves \\ntheir value realisation. Krishi Udan 2.0 was launched in October 2021 enhancing the existing provisions, mainly focusing on transporting perishable food products from the hilly areas, North-Eastern states, and tribal areas. For facilitating and incentivising the movement of agricultural produce by air transportation, the Airports Authority of India provides a full waiver of Landing, Parking charges, Terminal Navigational Landing Charges and Route Navigation Facility Charges for Indian freighters and Passenger-to-Cargo Aircraft primarily around 25 airports focusing on North Eastern, Hilly and Tribal region and 28 airports in other regions/areas. Further, five more airports have been included under the Scheme, making it 58 airports.\\n11.29   t rade Infrastructure for Export Scheme: The Government has been implementing \\nthe Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme since FY18 to assist Central and State Government 323\\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\\nAgencies in the creation of appropriate infrastructure for the growth of exports from the \\nStates. The Scheme provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid to Central/State Government owned agencies for setting up or for up-gradation of export infrastructure as per the guidelines of the Scheme. \\n11.30 districts as Export hubs – One District One Product Initiative:  The Districts as Export \\nHubs-ODOP initiative is aimed at targeting export promotion, manufacturing, and employment \\ngeneration at the grassroots level, making the States and Districts meaningful stakeholders and active participants in making India an export powerhouse thereby contributing to the AatmNirbhar mission and achieving the vision of Make in India for the world and being V ocal for Local. The initiative is also aimed at fostering balanced regional development across all districts of the country. It seeks to select, brand, and promote products/services from each district of the country for enabling holistic socioeconomic growth across all regions, attract investment in the district to boost manufacturing and exports. A growing emphasis on exports by focusing on districts as potential export hubs is also likely to integrate India more closely with the global value chain and propel India to be a significant exporter by leveraging the diversity and competitiveness in agriculture, marine, textile, pharmaceutical, chemicals and many engineering products. \\nIndia’s Global trade Engagements\\n11.31 This era of globalisation has been accompanied by a proliferation of trade agreements \\nand the emergence of competing trade blocs. These trends are affecting every business, every industry, and every country so that keeping up with these changes has become a challenging task for policymakers around the globe. Governments have been pursuing international trade cooperation largely driven by diverse external and internal political economy considerations such as promoting peace and stability, increasing market size and most importantly, insuring themselves against unfavourable trade policies of other countries.\\n11.32 India has always stood for an open, equitable, predictable, non-discriminatory, and rule-\\nbased international trading system. India considers Regional Trading Arrangements (RTAs) as \\n‘building blocks’ towards the overall objective of trade liberalisation and as complementing the multilateral trading system. Recognising that RTAs would continue to feature permanently in world trade, India has engaged with its trading partners/blocs with the intention of expanding its export market since the early part of the previous decade and began concluding, in principle agreements to move, in some cases, towards Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECA) which covers FTA in goods, services, investment and identifies areas of economic cooperation. \\n11.33 The economic rationale for FTAs was the diversification and expansion of India’s exports to its \\ntrading partners, providing a level playing field vis-à-vis the competing countries having preferential \\naccess in our trading partners, as well as gain easier access to raw materials and intermediate products, at lower costs, for stimulating value-added domestic manufacturing. In the case of the India-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), India-Korea, and India-Japan Agreements, this was also part of a geopolitical strategy that dovetailed well into India’s “Look East Policy.” \\n11.34 India has so far concluded 13 FTAs and 6 Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). The \\nmost recent in the list are the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement \\n(CEPA) which was signed on 18 February 2022 and officially entered into force on 1 May 324\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n2022 and the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA), \\nwhich was signed on 2 April 2022 and entered into force on 29 December 2022. Further, India is presently engaged in FTA negotiations with some of its trading partners, notable among these FTAs are – (i) India-UK FTA, (ii) India-Canada CEPA/ Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA), (iii) India-EU FTA.  Moreover, India has also initiated action to review some of the existing FTAs, namely, India-Singapore CECA, India-South Korea CEPA, and India-ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement and initiated discussions on scoping for the CECA with Australia, as envisaged under Ind-Aus ECTA.\\n12 Box XI.1 discusses the rise in the number of FTAs being \\nentered into worldwide and various factors that determine their usefulness to a trading partner.\\nBox xI.1:  free trade agreements\\nFTAs or RTAs in terms of the WTO rules13, are economic instruments available to a country for \\nleveraging its competencies in trade and investment.  As of June 2016, all WTO members now have \\nat least one RTA in force. There has been a substantial rise in the number of trade agreements with \\n355 notifications of RTAs having been made to the WTO (As of 1 December 2022– Source: WTO website). Many WTO members continue to be involved in negotiations to create new RTAs, which \\nare mostly bilateral. However, a recent development has been negotiations and new agreements \\namong more than two WTO members, such as:\\n• Pacific Alliance between Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (Signed on 10 February 2014; \\nentered into force on 1 May 2016);\\n• Tripartite Agreement, linking parties to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the \\nEast African Community and the Southern African Development Community (Launched on 10 \\nJune 2015 and entered into force at different dates by different members);\\n• Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (Signed on 8 March 2018; entered into force on 31 October 2018);\\n• African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) (Signed on 21 March 2018 and entered into force \\nat different dates by different members); and\\n• Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) between the ASEAN members and six other WTO members (Signed on 15 November 2020; entered into force on 1 January 2022).\\nThe limited progress in the multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO is one of the reasons responsible for the increase in FTAs. FTAs are viewed favourably by trading countries in comparison \\nto multilateral negotiation at the WTO forum as they are easy to negotiate and provide flexibility to \\nfactor in geopolitical considerations.\\nThe purpose of RTAs is to lower tariffs on goods and services and increase cooperation between \\ntrading partners with the aim of increasing trade, lower prices for consumers, and provide enhanced \\nexport opportunities for producers. RTAs can also have a larger impact on the economy. For instance, Bailé et al. (2019) found that FTAs are positively correlated with direct domestic value-added exports, \\nas well as forward and backward participation in global value chains.\\n12 For an understanding of various types of trade agreements that India has entered into, may refer to: https://www.tpci.in/research_report/types-\\nof-trade-agreements/.\\n13RTAs, as per WTO rules, are any reciprocal trade agreement between two or more partners, not necessarily belonging to the same region.325\\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\\nAccording to the conventional gravity model, developed by Tinbergen (1962), bilateral trade \\nbetween two nations is proportional to their respective sizes, measured by their GDPs and inversely \\nproportional to the geographic distance, a proxy for transportation cost. Over time, more variables, \\nsuch as exchange rates, income levels and shifting demand patterns, have been added to the standard gravity model to test their relevance in influencing trade (Osabuohien et al., 2019).\\nWhile an FTA provides the enabling environment for enhancing trade by reducing tariff and non-\\ntariff barriers (NTBs), the trade growth of a country depends on many factors, such as:\\n(a) Specific features of the FTA such as the extent of tariff relaxations given vis-à-vis the Most \\nFavoured Nation (MFN) tariffs\\n14, on which products they are given and how the relaxation is \\nstaggered, i.e., is it over a long time or short time that the relaxations are agreed to be rolled out.15  \\n(b) The extent of concessions in terms of Rules of Origin (RoO)16 and removal/easing of NTBs. \\nWhile tariff barriers are agreed to be reduced in an FTA, NTBs, such as sanitary and phytosanitary \\nmeasures, technical barriers to trade, contingent trade-protective measures etc., may lower the \\nutilisation of the FTAs by traders.\\n(c) The capacity of an economy to increase the supply of products/services for which the FTA \\nhas provided an enhanced export venue. This ‘supply-response’ is determined by a wide range \\nof factors which largely fall outside the ambit of an FTA. They include various policies on production aspects, a country’s physical and institutional infrastructure, and other elements determining the short-term flexibility of an economy. In other words, the supply-response is \\ngoverned by the potential for trade creation wherein a member of an FTA, having a comparative \\nadvantage in producing a product, is now able to sell it to its FTA partners because trade barriers \\nhave been removed (Viner, 1950). \\n(d) The effect of the FTA would also depend on income growth in the importing markets and the \\nprice competitiveness of exports of a partner country in a trade agreement so as to be able to take advantage of the agreement.\\nFurther, not all trade may happen through the FTA route, especially if the RoO are cumbersome or \\ngoods are already trading at MFN zero duty. In order to take advantage of the FTAs, these must be \\naggressively utilised by the traders and service providers. Thus, it may not happen that there will be a sudden or significant increase in trade after an FTA is signed between two or more countries. The \\ntrade balance would shift only gradually and may also turn out to not be in favour of each partner, \\ndepending on a host of factors, some of which are listed above. \\nrEfErEncES• Baier, S.L., Y .V .

This is generally done so that producers in the \\nimporting country can adjust to import competition. This typically occurs over 10 to 15 years after the ratification of the FTA.\\n16Rules of origin are the criteria needed to determine the national source of a product.

The widening of the current account deficit (CAD) in the second quarter of FY23 was mainly on account of a higher merchandise trade deficit of US$ 83.5 billion and an increase in net investment income outgo. For the period April- September 2022 (H1FY23), India recorded a CAD of 3.3 per cent of GDP on the back of an increase in the merchandise trade deficit, as compared with 0.2 per cent in H1FY22. However, a comparison with the position of the CAB for selected countries shows that India’s CAD is modest and within manageable limits.\\nxI.7: current account Balance (caB): Magnitude and composition\\n-6-4-20246\\n-40-30-20-100102030\\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\\n2020-21 2021-22 2022-23\\n(P)\\nPer cent of GDP  US$ Billion  CAB CAB to GDP ratio (RHS)\\n-100-80-60-40-20020406080\\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\\n2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 (P)US$ Billion Net Merch.

But huge valuation losses (US$ 48.9 billion) contributed to the net depletion of US$ 74.6 billion of reserves in nominal terms during the period.\\n11.43 India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 532.7 billion as of end-September 2022, \\ncovering 8.8 months of imports. The reserves augmented to US$ 562.7 billion as of end-\\nDecember 2022 covering 9.3 months of imports. As of end-November 2022, India was the sixth largest foreign exchange reserves holder in the world according to data compiled by the IMF. As seen from the graph, the import coverage of foreign currency reserves has declined since the pre-pandemic levels in most emerging market economies; however, that of India has increased from 95% in Q4 2019 to 96.5% in Q3 2022.

The drivers behind the accumulation of reserves have evolved over the years: initially for precautionary \\npurposes until the early 2000s, followed by goals of monetary and exchange rate policies (Arslan Yavuz, et al 2019). Accordingly, the FERs of several countries have witnessed a rising trend, more so \\nsince the global financial crisis of 2008.\\ntable: total foreign exchange reserves excluding gold (in uS$ bn)\\n2005 2008 2019 2020 2021nov-\\n2022%change:  \\n2021 over \\n2008\\nRussian Federation 175.9 411.8 443.9 457.0 497.6 567.3 20.8\\nIndia 131.9 247.4 432.4 549.1 594.4 555.3 140.3\\nBrazil 53.3 192.8 353.6 351.5 354.6 331.5 83.9\\nUnited States 54.1 66.6 118.4 133.9 240.2 237.8 260.7\\nUnited Kingdom 54.0 56.1 158.4 161.2 176.0 204.1 213.7\\nIndonesia 33.1 49.6 125.3 131.1 140.3 134.0 182.9\\nSouth Africa 18.6 30.6 48.9 47.4 50.3 60.0 64.4\\nAustralia 41.9 30.7 55.6 39.2 53.8 57.9 75.2\\nWorld 4395.0 7418.2 12195.3 13122.5 13944.7 11598.6*  88.0\\nSource: International Financial Statistics, IMF\\n*Figure as of Sept 2022\\nThis brings in the debate on adequacy of reserves. Conventionally, there are three measures of \\nadequacy of reserves, viz. ratios of reserves to imports, to monetary aggregates, and measures of external debt (IMF, 2000). According to the traditional approach to determining the adequacy of \\nreserves, the simple rule of thumb is three months of imports or full cover of short-term debt. As \\nregards the former, there is little empirical support for whether the adequate coverage should be three  \\nmonths, as opposed to say two or six (IMF, 2011). The latter derives from the Guidotti–Greenspan-IMF rule which states that a country\\'s reserves should equal short-term external debt (one-year or less maturity), suggesting a ratio of reserves-to-short term debt of one. The rationale is that countries332\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nshould have enough reserves to cope with the withdrawal of short-term foreign capital. Then there \\nare also money-based indicators of reserves which provide a measure of the potential for resident-\\nbased capital flight from the currency. The indicators used are the ratio of reserves to broad money or \\nthe ratio of reserves to base money which help in assessing reserve adequacy under fixed exchange rate regimes. Each of these indicators may, in themselves, not be adequate to assess the requirements \\nof FERs for an economy and different measures may typically be used for different purposes.\\nThe IMF (SM/00/65, 3/23/2000), noted the importance of short-term debt as a source of risk but cautioned \\nagainst excessive reliance on a single indicator and pointed to the need to consider various potential \\nsources of short-term demand for reserves. Further, IMF (SM/01/311, 10/16/2001) has noted the need \\nto complement indicator-based analyses with stress-testing of the BoP. In addition, there are customised \\nrisk-based broader-based metrics tailor-made to capture sources of risk emanating from external liabilities (debt and equity) as well as current account variables (export earnings) and some measure of potential \\ncapital flight (broad money) (IMF, 2011).  Adequacy should be considered against total resources available \\nto meet shocks, a broader concept than the BoP-determined definition of reserve assets.\\nWhile reserves are imperative in both preventing crises situations and mitigating their impact, there \\nis a cost involved in holding them and they are subject to diminishing returns. The costs borne by an \\neconomy for holding FER include the opportunity cost, in terms of the difference between domestic and foreign borrowing rates and loss due to the value reduction in the denominated FER. Rodrik \\n(2006) examines the social cost of FERs and finds that the income loss to most developing countries \\namounts to close to one per cent of GDP.\\nFukuda and Kon (2010) evaluate the macroeconomic impact of reserve accumulation and find evidence \\nthat an increase in FERs raises external debt outstanding but shortens debt maturity. Further, in the long-\\nrun, consumption declines, and exports, are promoted by encouraging a switch from the non-tradable \\nsector to the tradable sector through higher investment and growth. Further, FERs could be inflationary through exchange rate effects (Lin, et al 2009) and moral hazard and incentive effects (Chitu, 2016). \\nTherefore, an economy should organise its reserves FER, in terms of the optimal size and currency \\ncomposition, considering the benefits, costs, and impacts of holding them. Co-movement of the \\ndomestic currency with key currencies and the currency invoicing of trade (Ito, 2019); trade flows (trade invoicing), financial flows (share of debt service payments in a currency), and currency pegs \\n(Eichengreen, 2000) are the dominant factors influencing the currency composition of FERs.  Further, \\ndrawing from the field of finance, the Value at Risk (VaR) approach has also been employed to arrive at the optimal foreign exchange portfolio (Hung et al. (2008).   \\nAs briefly reviewed above, the rich literature on reserve adequacy presents very useful background \\ninformation and empirical analysis for policy choices and likely outcomes.\\nrEfErEncES\\n• Arslan, Yavuz and Cantú, Carlos (2019), “The size of foreign exchange reserves”, BIS Papers \\nNo 104.\\n• Chiou, J-S., Hung, J-C, and Hseu, M-M.

On a financial year \\nbasis, i.e., from April to December 2022, the INR has depreciated against US$ by 8.3 per cent.20 Over \\nthe same period, the US dollar has appreciated by 4.4 per cent in terms of the US dollar index.21 This \\nholds even on a calendar year basis, i.e., from January to December 2022, the INR has depreciated by 10.8 per cent whereas the US dollar has appreciated by 6.4 per cent. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate  (NEER) of the US dollar (27 economies)  appreciated by 7.8  per cent in  the calendar year 2022, up to December, while the NEER of India (64 economies) depreciated by 4.8 per cent. In other words, it is not that the INR has weakened, but it is the US dollar that has strengthened. No matter how many tweets are written against that observation, it is a fact. Several other currencies depreciated even more value against the US dollar than the INR (Refer Figure I.12 of Chapter I). Thus, the external value of INR vis-à-vis the US dollar has seen very orderly movements during the year since the onset of the current geopolitical crisis.  \\n11.45  Further, the INR appreciated against select major currencies barring the US dollar.  The \\naverage exchange rate of INR against the Pound Sterling appreciated by 6.7 per cent in April \\n-December 2022 over April - December 2021. This rate of appreciation was 14.5 per cent with respect to the Japanese Yen and 6.4 per cent against the Euro.\\n20 Change in Monthly average exchange rate in December 2022 over April 2022.\\n21The U.S. dollar index (US$X) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies.

On a financial year basis, i.e., between April 2022 and December 2022, the INR depreciated 3.4 per cent and 4.0 per cent measured in terms of 6-currency and 40-currency trade-weighted indices, respectively. Thus, even in real terms, the INR witnessed modest depreciation in the face of global spill overs.\\n11.47 In terms of the 6-currency NEER (trade-weighted), the rupee depreciated by 4.4 per cent \\nin December 2022 over April 2022. Similarly, the rupee depreciated by 4.7 per cent in terms of \\n40-currency NEER\\n22  (trade-weighted) in December 2022 over April 2022.\\nxI.17: Movement of Index of 6-currency and 40-currency nEEr and rEEr  \\n(trade-based weight) (the base Year 2015-16 = 100)\\n98100102104106\\n8283848586878889\\nMar 2022\\nApr 2022\\nMay 2022\\nJun 2022\\nJul 2022\\nAug 2022\\nSep 2022\\nOct 2022\\nNov 2022\\nDec 2022Index6-Currency                       \\nNEER REER (RHS)\\n98100102104106\\n8688909294\\nMar 2022\\nApr 2022\\nMay 2022\\nJun 2022\\nJul 2022\\nAug 2022\\nSep 2022\\nOct 2022\\nNov 2022\\nDec 2022Index40 Currency \\nNEER REER (RHS)a. 6- currency trade-Based b. 40- currency trade Based\\nSource: RBI\\n22 The indices NEER and REER are used as indicators of external competitiveness.

The REER, defined as a weighted average of nomi-nal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between the domestic and foreign countries, relates to the PPP  hypothesis.335\\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\\nInternational Investment position: a reflection of India\\'s financial \\nSoundness\\n11.48 The international investment position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point \\nin time the value and composition of (a) financial assets of residents of an economy that are \\nclaims on non-residents and gold bullion held as reserve assets, and (b) liabilities of residents of an economy to non-residents. The difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.\\n23 The Net IIP position \\ndetermines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference in its external assets and liabilities. These statistics serve as an indicator of a country’s financial condition and soundness. The Net IIP, along with the BoP transactions, reflects the domestic economy’s set of international accounts.\\n11.49 For India, as of end-September 2022, Indian residents’ overseas financial assets at US$ \\n847.5 billion were lower by US$ 73.0 billion or 7.9 per cent compared to the level as of end-\\nMarch 2022, mainly due to the reduction in reserve assets even as trade credit and overseas direct investment recorded an increase. Reserve assets at US$ 532.7 billion, accounting for around 62.9 per cent of India’s international financial assets fell by 12.3 per cent over the same period. \\n11.50 International liabilities at US$ 1,237.1 billion as of end-September 2022 were lower by \\nUS$ 41.6 billion (3.2 per cent) as compared to the level as of end-March 2022. This fall was \\nattributed primarily to direct investment (net) outflows, while variations in the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis other currencies also had an impact on the change in liabilities when valued in US$ terms. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 50 per cent as of end-September 2022. \\n11.51 Thus, the net claims of non-residents on India, valued at US$ 389.6 billion as of end-\\nSeptember 2022, increased by US$ 31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022. India’s \\ninternational financial assets covered 68.5 per cent of international financial liabilities as of end-September 2022.\\nxI.18: India’s net International Investment position in end-September 2022\\n-388 -390\\n-16.4-11.5\\n-18-16-14-12-10-8-6-4-20\\n-500-450-400-350-300-250-200-150-100-500\\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Sept 2022\\n(P)\\nPer cent of GDPUS$ BillionNet IIP Net IIP to GDP- RHS\\n59.560.259.562.171.172.0\\n68.5\\n4045505560657075\\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 SEPT 2022 \\n(P)a. net IIp  and as percentage to Gdp b. asset liabilities ratio (in per cent\\nSource: RBI; P: Provisional\\n23 IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6),336\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nSafe and Sound External debt Situation\\n11.52 India’s external debt, at US$ 610.5 billion as of end-September 2022, grew by 1.3 per \\ncent (US$ 7.6 billion) over US$ 602.9 billion as of end-September 2021. However, external debt \\nas a ratio to GDP fell to 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022 from 20.3 per cent a year ago. The literature documents that the optimal threshold for India’s external debt is around 23-24 per cent of GDP.\\n24 Thus, India has the potential growth positive space as far as the external debt \\nlevel is concerned. While testifying to the prudent management of India’s external debt, this contrasts with the external debt distress unfolding in many peer countries, post-covid.  \\n11.53 The long-term debt was lower at US$ 478.7 billion as of end-September 2022 than \\nUS$ 498.1 billion a year ago with the share of long-term debt falling to 78.4 per cent from \\n82.8 per cent during the same period. On the other hand, the short-term debt at US$ 131.7 billion as of end-September 2022 was higher than US$ 104.8 billion as of end-September 2021. Accordingly, the share of short-term debt in total debt went up to 21.6 per cent from 17.4 per cent. In this context, it needs to be noted that about 97 per cent of short-term debt is in the form of trade credit to finance imports and hence the rise in short-term debt is stability-friendly. Further, while a major part of India’s external debt is denominated in the US dollar (55.5 per cent as at-September 2002), the Indian rupee-denominated component (30.2 per cent) occupies the second largest position, insulating the external debt from foreign currency risk, thereby augmenting stability friendly characteristics of the external debt.  \\n11.54 As of end-September 2022, Sovereign External Debt (SED) amounted to US$ 124.5 \\nbillion, decreasing by 5.7 per cent over the level a year ago. Non-SED, estimated at US$ 486.0 \\nbillion as of end-September 2022, posted a growth of 3.2 per cent over the level a year ago. Deposit-taking Corporations (except the Central Bank) and non-financial corporations accounted for the bulk of non-SED. \\n11.55 The Ministry of Finance’s “India’s External Debt: A Status Report 2019-20”, provides \\ndetails of the evolution of India’s external debt.\\n25 A discernible trend in the rise in external debt \\nof the non-sovereign sector over the SED is seen since FY99. Accordingly, typically, in a normal \\nyear, it is the relative movements in non-SED that influences the dynamics of the country’s external debt. In the pandemic year of FY21, it was the growth in SED that accounted for a larger share of the overall growth of foreign debt due to Covid-19 loans from multilateral institutions.  As the pandemic receded and normalcy was restored with the revival of the economy, the usual dynamics of India’s external debt returned as the growth in non-SED constituted as much as 4.7 percentage points out of the overall external debt growth of 8.0 per cent at end-March 2022. However, the quarter ending September 2022, yet again witnessed deviation from the usual dynamics. It was the relative growth in SED (akin to the pandemic year) that influenced the overall external debt dynamics on the back decline in external assistance as well as other government debt which includes FPI investment in G-Sec and SDR. Out of the overall decline in India’s external debt by 0.4 per cent, the fall in the SED was 0.5 per cent, while the rise in non-SED was 0.2 per cent.    \\n24 Gopinath, Tulasi and Rajeshwar.

External debt as a \\nratio to GDP at 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022 was lower than 19.9 per cent as of end-\\nMarch 2022. The debt service ratio (principal repayments plus interest payments) stood at 5.0 per cent vis-à-vis 5.2 per cent as of end-March 2022. \\n11.57  Comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 2021 \\ninforms that the country is in a better position in terms of relatively low levels of total debt as a \\npercentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short-term debt as a percentage of total debt.

The empirical \\nliterature documents that global growth exerts a strong statistically and economically significant \\nimpact on India’s real exports, though the impact has reduced over the years.26 As noted earlier \\n(para 11.2), global growth is forecast to slow down in 2022 and 2023 as per IMF estimates.  This is the weakest growth profile since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. \\n11.59 Thus, the export outlook may remain flat in the coming year if global growth does not \\npick up in 2023, as indicated by many forecasts. In such cases, product basket and destination \\ndiversification which India is taking through FTAs would be useful to enhance trade opportunities. At times when the base (global growth and global trade) is not growing, export growth will have to come predominantly through market share gains. In turn, that comes from the focus on efficiency, productivity, technology, and innovation. That game has to be lifted. Governments can try and open markets through FTAs. But, to take advantage of that is in the hands of private sector participants.\\n11.60  India is facing competition from South Asian countries in a few of its export competitive \\nproducts. In the textile sector, Bangladesh and Vietnam are seen to be expanding their exports \\nglobally, in recent years. Further, Vietnam has been able to expand its exports in machinery and equipment; computers, electronic products, certain agriculture products etc. However, given the benefits of the lower average age of the working population along with the advantage of economies of scale, India has the potential to cater to the global demand for several products in a cost-effective manner.\\n11.61  On the imports side, notwithstanding uncertainty surrounding the outlook on global \\ncrude oil prices, the recent softening in its prices augurs well for India’s POL imports. However, \\nnon-oil, non-gold imports, which are growth-sensitive, may not witness a significant slowdown as Indian growth continues to be resilient. \\n11.62 While recognising the potential adverse developments, it is important to take cognisance \\nof innate buffers to India’s external sector. India’s export of services, primarily contributed by \\nsoftware, business, and travel services, while remaining robust during the year so far, embodies a greater degree of resilience. India is cementing its position as the top remittance receiver in the world, with inward remittances projected to be at record levels during 2022. Accordingly, a large surplus under services and remittances would cushion the widening trade deficit. Consolidating an increasing share of non-debt flows in financing CAD over the years, net FDI flows remained robust during the current year, while the net FPI inflows turned positive in recent months. Thus, the CAD would be within manageable limits and eminently financeable. Above all, the forex reserves remained comfortable at US$ 562.7 billion as of end-December 2022, covering 9.3 months of imports. The stock of India’s external debt has been prudently managed. \\n26Chinoy, S. Z and Jain, T (2018): What Drives India’s Exports and What Explains the Recent Slowdown? New Evidence and Policy  \\nImplications; NCAER, Policy Forum; https://www.ncaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/a4.pdf340\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n11.63 From a cross-country perspective too, India’s external sector has fared relatively \\nbetter and hence positioned relatively stronger to face the evolving adverse global scenario as \\nevidenced by the Indian rupee outperforming most EME currencies, comfortable import cover and moderate CAD. India’s external debt vulnerability indicators are benign by international standards. To sum up, while India’s external sector faces challenges, it is performing relatively better as compared to many of its peers as it has inbuilt shock absorbers to weather them. CHAPTER12\\nThe invention of the wheel set in motion the necessity of travelable paths, and since then \\nthe saga of infrastructure has expanded from canals to modern capital structures such as railways, roads etc. depending on the necessities of the region. In the last 75 years in India since Independence, infrastructure development has moved on a consistent growth curve building the assets required by the nation across sectors such as transportation, housing, commercial development, telecom and most recently, sanitation. As a key enabler of socio-economic enhancement of a region, the government has used ‘social overhead capital’ to push development in the remotest areas of the country through dedicated budgetary allocation, cross-subsidising revenue-generating infrastructure and focussed programme delivery. This has helped in expanding physical transportation and connectivity, providing services at point-of-use and deepening digital penetration.\\nInfrastructure, being a melange of numerous sectors, its multiplier effects in the economy \\ncannot be realised if it operates in silos. Thus, in 2019, Government of India adopted a forward-looking programmatic approach towards infrastructure. The National Infrastructure Pipeline was born with a projected investment of around ₹111 lakh crore for FY20-25 for developing a comprehensive view of infrastructure development in the country, monitoring its progress at the highest levels in the government for timely completion, and enabling a pipeline view for investors for them to plan infrastructure investments. The funding for infrastructure comes from a variety of sources, from government to private sector to multilateral. However, given the quantum of funding involved, a creative financing option such as asset monetisation was also envisaged through the 5 lakh crore National Monetisation Pipeline. Apart from generating critical financial resources, private participation in running risk-free brownfield assets will also help in ushering in operational efficiencies and better management of public assets. \\nThe programmatic approach to infrastructure is complemented by structural and \\nfinancial reforms such as infrastructure financing options of InvITs and REITs, creation of Dedicated Financing Institution (NaBFID), recapitalisation of other sectoral DFIs, push to PPP ecosystem through Model Concession Agreements by line ministries and enabling social infrastructure development through the revamped Viability Gap Funding scheme.\\nTo bring in further convergence with comprehensive planning across centre and states, \\nPM GatiShakti has sectoral complementarity of logistics facilitation through the National Logistics Policy launched in Sept 2022. All of this is expected to tighten the nuts and bolts for the arduous infrastructure journey that our country has undertaken together by the Physical and digital  \\ninfrastructure: lifting \\nPotential growth342\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nparticipation of centre, state, local governments and the private sector.\\nThis story has seen many successes. While roads, railways, and waterways have \\nseen unprecedented expansion in the last eight years, ports and airports have been substantially upgraded. This has also helped the country move from unimodal to multi-modal transportation, providing a window of opportunity to the private sector to invest and reinvest in these assets, which has already been facilitated by the policy of asset monetisation.  Extending infrastructural facilities is only part of the story; modernisation is the other important principle that has been attempted with verve and achieved with commendable speed.  \\nIn keeping with the winds of change around the globe, we have placed a great emphasis \\non digital and communications development, but, have taken the principle to new heights in terms of usability, interoperability and accessibility. The country has come a long way from a time when a basic telephone connection was viewed as a luxury, to a stage where most individuals now have a mobile connection. It is not a hyperbole to state that with the thrust on Digital India, the story of digital infrastructure and services in India will always be seen by the world with a certain regard and appreciation. In a very short time, the country has seen a great multiplier effect on social and economic growth through the different uses of digital enablement led by the humble mobile phone and the Aadhar number– targeted beneficiary identification for various benefits, provision of healthcare and education services and financial inclusion.  Close on this, arrived the success story of India’ s sui-generis payment infrastructure (UPI), which travelled internationally with select adoption and global acclaim. The bouquet of digital public infrastructure products like e-rupi,e-way bill, TReDS for MSMEs etc have ensured real value for money to consumers while reducing the compliance burden for producers.  And now, with the vision of $1 trillion digital economy by 2025, the government is marching towards providing more and more e-governance based services.\\nAll of these developments are a testament to the fact that India has been one of the few \\ncountries where innovation in technology and digital connectivity has been and continues to be led by the public sector. The success of UPI, a common platform that serves as the backbone for diverse developments, has prompted government to task itself with another innovative attempt towards democratising digital commerce through the ONDC which could potentially transform how businesses and consumers interact at present. Empowering the end-users with control over their data is an essential ongoing task that is guided by the Account Aggregator framework. \\nAs the developments would indicate, the world has moved seamlessly from the focus \\non physical infrastructure to investing in digital infrastructure. Moving forward, it is almost a certainty that most of the future real-world applications are going to marry the two, something akin to that attempted under Smart Cities, that interlocks area-based development with digital assets and digital services. \\nIn the context of unique challenges, which only a country with a billion people can face, \\nIndia’ s infrastructure journey has been global in outlook, but domestic in innovation and implementation.343\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nintroduction\\n12.1 As India completes 75 years of Independence, the nation is evolving into a prominent \\nforce in the global economic order. India is the world’s fifth largest economy and the prospect of \\nsteady progress in the coming years is bright. Here, the critical role played by infrastructure in economic growth cannot be overemphasised. Investing in high-quality infrastructure\\n1 is crucial \\nfor accelerating economic growth and sustaining it in the long run. As the empirical evidence states, this has a salutary effect on the productivity and efficiency of Indian manufacturing firms\\n2. \\nIt further plays a significant role in poverty reduction3 and promotes both rural and agricultural \\ndevelopment4,5. Empirical evidence also points to the positive effect of infrastructure towards \\nbringing overall economic growth in India6. \\nfigure Xii.1: Quantity and quality of infrastructure and level of  \\neconomic development across countries are strongly correlated\\n 020000400006000080000100000\\n100 600 1100 1600 2100GDP per capita, current \\ninternational $\\nTotal infrastructure investment per \\ncapita, constant 2015 US$Correlation: 0.75\\n020000400006000080000100000120000\\n1 3 5 7GDP per capita, current \\ninternational $\\nQuality of overall infrastructureCorrelation: 0.76\\nNote: The left graph pertains to 2019, and the right graph pertains to 2018.\\nQuality of overall infrastructure: 1=worst and 7=best.Source: World Bank, Global Infrastructure Hub, and World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index\\n12.2 The above correlation between infrastructure and development brings us to the present \\nscenario when during the times of pandemic and geo-political crisis, the government kept its \\nfocus on reforms in areas of physical, digital and regulatory infrastructure. In order to increase the private sector participation in creation of new infrastructure and development of existing ones, the government took initiatives like Public-Private Partnership (PPP), National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP).

This buffet of reforms on all \\naspects related to infrastructure investment and project execution not just ensures economic growth and economic efficiency but also generates confidence among various stakeholders in the economy towards government functioning.\\n12.3 Building upon it, the government has also kept its focus towards developing the traditional \\ninfrastructure like roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport and waterways.  These play a \\nvital role in national integration and regional development. The mechanisms like multi-modal transport system have also been put in place. The multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for movement of people and goods from one mode of transport to another. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity and also reduce travel time for people, further reducing the logistics cost and promoting export competitiveness. These measures collectively can bring out the untapped potential of underutilised modes of infrastructure.\\n12.4 With increasing financialisation of the economy and penetration of digital services, growth \\nin physical infrastructure alone could not be the answer for development. Though India\\'s digital \\njourney predates the pandemic, it would be rational to say that the testing times of the pandemic have accelerated its acceptance, application and coverage in many ways. The adaptability displayed by the citizens towards technology-driven changes was very encouraging. This confluence of digitisation and innovation acted as a game changer for India. \\n12.5 Reflecting on the journey of digital infrastructure growth and its global adoption, it is \\npertinent to mention that in 2009, only 17 per cent of adults in India had bank accounts, 15 \\nper cent used digital payments, 1 in 25 had a unique ID document, and about 37 per cent had mobile phones. Today, these numbers have seen a meteoric rise — tele density has reached up to 93 per cent, over a billion people have a digital ID document, more than 80 per cent have bank accounts, and as of 2022, over 600 crore of digital payment transactions are completed per month. A Bank for International Settlements (BIS) working paper\\n7 has estimated that progress \\ntowards financial inclusion, which would have taken almost half a century had India followed traditional growth processes, was achieved in India in just about ten years. \\n12.6 Today, India is able to offer many best practices, particularly with respect to its digital \\ninfrastructure innovations, that can be emulated globally. Successful vaccination drive through \\nthe one-stop Co-WIN portal, DigiLocker, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN), Goods and Services Tax (GST) Sahay are a few success stories among many. The National Payments Corporation of India International (NPCIL) led Unified Payment Interface (UPI) is another such innovation which transformed the payment landscape. UPI based transactions grew both in value and volume terms, paving the way for its international adoption. \\n12.7 Capitalising on the digital infrastructure support, India has also emerged as one of the \\nworld\\'s most vibrant destinations for start-up ecosystems. Start-ups are being envisioned as the \\nspine of new India, as they encourage the youth to become job creators rather than job seekers. With the highest FinTech adoption rate of 87 per cent among the public compared to the global average of 64 per cent, India has gained the 3rd place in digital payments\\n8 only after US and \\n7\\u2002https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap106.pdf, page 4.\\n8\\u2002https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/fintech/indias-fintech-market-size-at-31-billion-in-2021-third-largest-in-world \\nreport/88794336 BLinC per cent20report_Fintech_2022.pdf345\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nChina, signifying that India has an untapped market. These untapped opportunities, along with the \\nfavourable ecosystem, creates a large growth potential for FinTechs in India.  Taking this vision forward, under the government\\'s policy initiative, a world-class FinTech Hub at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT) International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) has been developed.\\n12.8 This is just an illustration of the opportunities that exist. The massive wave of digitisation, \\nincreased penetration of smartphones, and adoption of technology have opened the doors for \\nboth traditional and new-age sectors. The rollout of 5G services can unleash new economic opportunities and help the country leapfrog the traditional barriers to development, spur innovations by start-ups and business enterprises, and advance the \\'Digital India\\' vision. The journey is far from complete, and a lot remains to be accomplished to realise our true potential. \\n12.9 To summarise, this chapter covers the recent and past experiences of the government in \\ntransforming and inter-locking the potential of physical, regulatory and digital infrastructure. \\nIn doing so, the chapter looks to answer the following: How have the various infrastructural sectors fared after the Covid-19 shock? How has the government leveraged digital technologies in the service of the public? How far has the government been able to determine the role of  \\nco-ordination and efficiency in infrastructure projects and what is the government’s vision towards infrastructure development? In doing so, we will cover the government’s plans to place India among the top three global economies and inch closer to the status of a developed nation by the 100th year of its Independence. \\ngovernment’s Vision and approaches to infrastructure development in india\\n12.10 Increase in infrastructure investment provides a critical push to the potential growth of \\nthe economy. The government, in recent years, provided an increased impetus for infrastructure development and investment through the enhancement of capital expenditure. This push has happened at a time of crisis when the capital expenditure by the private sector has been subdued. The outlay (target) for capital expenditure in 2022-23 (BE) was increased sharply by 35.4 per cent from ₹ 5.5 lakh crore in the previous year (2021-22) to ₹ 7.5 lakh crore, of which approximately 67 per cent has been spent from April to December 2022. \\nfigure Xii.2: central government has sharply increased capital \\nexpenditure in the last two consecutive years*\\n 3.44.15.57.5\\n13%22%34%35%\\n0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%\\n0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.0\\nFY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\\ngrowth (per cent)Capital ex penditure (₹ Lakh Crore)\\nGBS YoY growth in Capex\\n   * All figures are representative of Budgeted Estimates for the respective Financial Year\\n   Source: Union Budget of India346\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n12.11  The result of the efforts is visible in Ministries’/ Departments’ Capex spending till \\nDecember 2022, which has been ₹5 lakh crore (around 67 per cent has been achieved against \\nthe Budgeted Capex of 7.5 lakh crore) as against ₹3.9 lakh crore for the same period in FY22 (i.e., till December 2021). The actual expenditure in FY23 is also 28 per cent higher than the expenditure in FY22 for the corresponding period.\\n12.12  The steady increase in public capital expenditure has helped support economic growth \\nwhile laying the foundation for future growth as capital assets boost economic efficiency and \\npotential growth. It could also crowd in private investment, as the IMF observed in the case of India\\n9. This is evident from the fact that capacity utilisation in the private sector has been \\nrecovering.\\n12.13 While the NIP and the NMP would provide the much-needed impetus for stepping up \\ninfrastructure investment, the NLP will address the gaps in services, digital infrastructure and \\nskills in the logistics workforce. PM GatiShakti, with a multimodal approach, is designed to fill the gaps in physical infrastructure and to integrate existing and proposed infrastructure development initiatives of different agencies. As physical infrastructure requires continuous support over its long gestation period, the government has also set up National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) as development financial institution to set in motion a virtuous investment cycle. An institutional mechanism to fast-track investments has been put in place, in the form of Project Development Cells (PDCs) in all concerned Ministries/ Departments of Government of India. \\n12.14 The government’s vision for infrastructure does not stop here. As India has already \\nsubmitted its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy at COP27, the next leap would \\nbe towards advanced infrastructure, which is more energy efficient, incorporates the idea of a circular economy and transitions towards low carbon development. The amount of investment that may be needed for putting in place climate resilient and climate resistant infrastructure might be too vast to be provided for by either the public sector or the private sector alone. Both financing and the creation of such infrastructure are likely to require Public-Private Partnership, a topic to which we turn next.\\nPublic-Private Partnerships (PPPs)\\n12.15 Private investment in infrastructure is mainly in the form of PPPs. PPPs are vital instruments \\nfor governments in channelling the strength of private sector in critical areas of infrastructure. It helps to address infrastructure gap and improve efficiency in infrastructure service delivery. The very success of PPPs lies in the robustness of institutional structure, financial support, and use and availability of standardised documents, such as Model Request for Qualification (RFQ), Model Request for Proposal (RFP) and Model Concession Agreements (MCAs).\\n12.16 In India, private participation in infrastructure programmes supports several PPP models, \\nincluding management contracts like Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Design-Build-Finance-\\nOperate-Transfer (DBFOT), Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer (ROT), Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM), and Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) model. Under the BOT model, there are two variants – BOT (Toll) and BOT (Annuity) depending on who bears the traffic risk. In the case of BOT \\n9\\u2002Bahal, Girish & Raissi, Mehdi & Tulin, V olodymyr. (2018). Crowding-Out or Crowding-In? Public and Private Investment in India.347\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\n(Toll), the traffic risk is borne by the PPP concessionaire, while in the case of BOT (Annuity), it \\nis borne by the public authority. \\n12.17  The Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC), the apex body for appraisal \\nof PPP projects in the Central Sector has streamlined appraisal mechanism to ensure speedy \\nappraisal of projects, eliminate delays, adopt international best practices and have uniformity in appraisal mechanism and guidelines. The PPPAC is chaired by Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) with Secretaries of Department of Expenditure, Department of Legal Affairs, the Sponsoring Ministry/Department and CEO, NITI Aayog as members to consider and appraise the \\nproposals for Central Sector PPP Projects. The Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee \\nhas cleared 79 projects with a total project cost of ₹2,27,268.1 crore from FY15 to FY23.\\n12.18 To provide financial assistance to financially unviable but socially/ economically \\ndesirable PPP projects, DEA launched the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme in 2006. Under \\nthis scheme, economic sector projects may get up to 40 per cent of Capex as VGF grant. The Scheme includes higher provisions of VGF grant for social sectors. Social sectors may get up to 80 per cent of the Capex and up to 50 per cent of the Operating Expenditure (Opex) for five years after Commercial Operation Date (CoD) as VGF grant.      \\n12.19  Social Sector projects get VGF under two categories: Sub Scheme-1 and Sub-Scheme-2. \\nSub-Scheme-1 caters to social sectors such as wastewater treatment, water supply, solid waste \\nmanagement etc. The projects under this category should have at least 100 per cent Operational Cost recovery. The Government of India (GoI) will provide a maximum of 30 per cent of Capex and the State Government concerned may provide an additional support of up to 30 per cent of Capex. Sub-scheme 2 supports demonstration/pilot projects from Health & Education sectors. The projects eligible under this category should have at least 50 per cent Operational Cost recovery.  The GoI will provide a maximum of 40 per cent of the Capex of the project and a maximum of 25 per cent of the Opex of the project for the first five years of commercial operations as VGF.\\n12.20 From 2014-15 to 2022-23, under the VGF Scheme, 56 projects with TPC of ₹57870.1 \\ncrore were granted In-Principle Approval and 27 projects with TPC of ₹25263.8 crore were \\ngranted final approval with a Total Viability Gap Funding approval of ₹5813.6 crore (Both GoI & State Share). The GoI share of approved VGF is ₹3102.6 crore and the State Share of Total VGF approved is ₹2710.9 crore. The total VGF amount disbursed by DEA under the scheme from FY15 to FY23 is ₹2982.4 crore. \\n12.21 A scheme for financial support for project development expenses of PPP Projects – \\nthe ‘India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme’ (IIPDF) – was notified by the \\ngovernment on 3 November 2022. The aim of the scheme is to develop quality PPP projects by providing necessary funding support to the project-sponsoring authorities, both in the Central and State Governments, for creating a shelf of bankable, viable PPP projects by on-boarding transaction advisers. \\n12.22  IIPDF Scheme has a total outlay of ₹150 crore for a period of 3 years from FY23 to \\nFY25. Under the scheme, a maximum amount of ₹5 crore for a single proposal, inclusive of any \\ntax implications, can be funded, which can include the cost of consultants/transaction advisers of a PPP project. Any funding requirement over and above ₹5 crore may be borne by the project sponsoring authority itself, and funding under IIPDF shall not be recovered.348\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nnational infrastructure Pipeline (niP)\\n12.23 A developing economy such as ours requires a continued stepping up of infrastructure \\ninvestment to sustain a high rate of growth, which in turn is a pre-requisite for achieving wide-\\nranging social objectives. In view of this, the government launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) with a forward-looking approach and with a projected infrastructure investment of around ₹111 lakh crore during FY20-25 to provide high quality infrastructure across the country. It also envisages improving project preparation and attracting domestic and foreign investment in infrastructure. The NIP includes infrastructure projects of more than ₹100 crore \\ncovering greenfield and brownfield investments. The NIP currently has 8,964 projects with \\na total investment of more than ₹108 lakh crore under different stages of implementation. Regarding sectoral composition, the transport sector constituted more than half of the projects. \\nfigure Xii.3: status of Projects under niP\\n  - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\\nUnder Conceptualization Under Development Under Implementation₹ lakh croreTotal Project Cost  Total Capital Outlay\\n   Source: Department of Economic Affairs. \\n   Note: Data as of 13 January 2023\\nfigure Xii.4: transportation sector dominates the niP\\n  - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\\nCom mercial\\nInfrastructureCommunication Energy Logistics Social\\nInfrastructureTransport Water &\\nSanitation₹ lakh croreTotal Project Cost Total Capital Outlay\\n \\u2002 Source: Department of Economic Affairs. \\n \\u2002 Note: Data as of 13 January 2023\\n12.24 NIP is hosted on the Invest India Grid (IIG) platform and provides opportunities for \\nStates/UTs and Ministries to collate all major infrastructure projects at a single location. IIG thus \\nacts as a centralised portal to track and review project progress across all economic and social infrastructure sub-sectors. The portal also enables project-sponsoring authorities to showcase investment opportunities to national and international investors. Project Monitoring Group (PMG) is an institutional mechanism put in place by the government for resolution of issues related to large-scale projects. PMG is also involved in the fast-tracking of approvals/clearances 349\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nfor projects with an anticipated investment of ₹500 crore and above. Now, it has been proposed \\nto integrate NIP and PMG portals. When implemented, NIP will become the first entry point (database) for all infrastructure projects (costing ₹100 crore or more). PMG portal will pick up data, as per requirements (project cost of  ₹500 crore or more), from the NIP database. This will save substantial time and effort by Ministries and States/UTs and ease the monitoring of large infrastructure projects.\\nnational Monetisation Pipeline – creation through monetisation \\n12.25  The need for scaling up infrastructure investment despite fiscal pressures from Covid-19 \\npandemic required unlocking of capital from various projects across sectors. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), was thus announced on 23 August 2021. Based on the principle of ‘asset creation through monetisation’, it taps private sector investment for new infrastructure creation. \\n12.26  It is expected that private players would operate and maintain the assets. The NMP provides \\nan opportunity for deleveraging balance sheets and providing fiscal space for investment in new \\ninfrastructure assets. The estimated aggregate monetisation potential under NMP is ₹6.0 lakh crore through core assets of the Central Government, over a four-year period, from FY20-25. \\n12.27  The process of monetisation entails a limited period license/ lease of an asset, owned by \\nthe government or a public authority, to a private sector entity for upfront or periodic consideration. \\nFunds so received by the public authority are reinvested in new infrastructure or deployed for other public purposes. Such contracts include provisions for the transfer of assets back to the authority at the end of the contract period. It includes a selection of de-risked and brownfield assets with a stable revenue generation profile (or long-term revenue rights) that can be clearly ring-fenced. It contains 20+ asset classes across 12+ line ministries/ departments.  In addition, the top 5 sectors (by estimated value) capture around 83 per cent of the aggregate pipeline value: roads (27 per cent) followed by railways (25 per cent), power (15 per cent), oil & gas pipelines (8 per cent), and telecom (6 per cent). Roads and railways together contribute around 52 per cent of the total NMP value.\\n12.28 Against the monetisation target of ₹0.9 lakh crore in FY22, ₹0.97 lakh crore have been \\nachieved during the period under roads, power, coal and mines. The cumulative investment \\npotential over the years of transactions completed is estimated at ₹9.0 lakh crore (value captured in the form of accruals, receipts, and/or private investment). NMP’s 2nd year, i.e., FY23, target envisaged is ₹1.6 lakh crore (27 per cent of overall NMP Target) under Core-Asset Monetisation. This is an indicative value while the actual realization for public assets may differ depending on the timing, transaction structuring, investor interest, etc.\\nnational logistics Policy: reducing the cost of logistics\\n12.29 Given that India aims to increase its exports manifold, it is important that the logistics \\naspects, that will facilitate this goal, be addressed. Logistics costs in India have been in the range of 14-18 per cent of GDP against the global benchmark of 8 per cent. Key dimensions to be addressed to improve logistics for trade include: ensuring efficiency of the clearance process (i.e., speed, simplicity, and predictability of formalities) by border control agencies, including customs; improving the quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure (e.g., ports, railroads, roads, information technology); easing of arranging competitively priced shipments; enhancing the competence and quality of logistics services (e.g., transport operators, customs brokers); 350\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nproviding for tracking and tracing of consignments and ensuring timeliness of shipments in \\nreaching destinations within the scheduled or expected delivery time. These aspects have been captured by the World Bank in the form of a Logistics Performance Index (LPI).\\n12.30 Many efforts have already been made by the Government of India to improve the logistics \\necosystem through ‘infrastructure initiatives’ such as Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN), \\nBharatmala, Sagarmala, Parvatamala, National Rail Plan, and through ‘process reforms’ GST, e-Sanchit, Single Window Interface for Trade (SWIFT), Indian Customs Electronic Data Interchange Gateway (ICEGATE), Turant Customs, and others.\\n12.31 However, a need was felt to integrate all these efforts by different government agencies \\nand lay an overarching interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral, and multi-jurisdictional framework for \\nthe logistics sector. To realise this idea, NLP was launched on 17 September 2022, addressing the components of improving efficiency in logistics through streamlining processes, regulatory framework, skill development, and mainstreaming logistics among others. \\n12.32 The vision of the NLP is “to develop a technologically enabled, integrated, cost-efficient, \\nresilient, sustainable and trusted logistics ecosystem in the country for accelerated and inclusive \\ngrowth.” The policy is an endeavour to improve the competitiveness of Indian goods, enhance economic growth and increase employment opportunities. It is aimed at bringing global standards to warehousing, multimodal digital integration, ease of logistics services, human resources, and skill enhancement.\\n12.33 The targets for achieving the vision of the NLP are to (i) reduce the cost of logistics in \\nIndia to be comparable to global benchmarks by 2030; (ii) improve the Logistics Performance \\nIndex ranking - endeavour is to be among the top 25 countries by 2030, and (iii) create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.\\n12.34 The Policy will be implemented through a Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP). \\nThe interventions under the CLAP are divided into specific key action areas, including Integrated \\nDigital Logistics Systems, standardisation of physical assets & benchmarking service quality standards, Logistics Human Resources Development and Capacity Building, State Engagement, EXIM (Export-Import) Logistics, Service Improvement framework, Sectoral Plan for Efficient Logistics and Facilitation of Development of Logistics Parks.  \\n12.35 Among other steps taken to enhance logistics performance in the country, there has been \\nan initiative to undertake a sub-national view of the state of logistics in the country through \\nthe Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) index. The following Box provides some details of this initiative.\\n10\\nBox Xii.1: logistics ease across different states\\nThe Government undertook a survey-based assessment of logistics ease in various States and UTs in the form of the LEADS index in 2018 to gauge their logistics ecosystem. It was followed by surveys in 2019, 2021, and 2022\\n10. Each of these surveys has been aimed at \\nanalysing the business environment at the State level relating to the logistics infrastructure, policy framework, and regulatory regime, across States and UTs.\\n10\\u2002The survey could not be undertaken in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.351\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nIt is based on a stakeholders’ survey and uses the World Bank’s Logistics Performance \\nIndex (LPI) methodology. The State LPI is arrived at using a ranking methodology for stakeholder engagement based on a series of meetings and online surveys in the key areas of logistics- infrastructure, services timelines, traceability, competitiveness, security, operating environments, and efficiency of regulation. Following the LEADS initiative, 13 States/UTs have prepared and notified their logistic policies.\\nThe LEADS 2022 survey report was released on 13 October 2022, which considered the \\nPM GatiShakti NMP and current developments in the logistics sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey has garnered more than 6500 responses from more than 2100 respondents across the country. Unlike the previous versions of LEADS which were based on ranking systems for all states, LEADS 2022 has adopted a classification-based grading, and States have been now classified under four categories viz., coastal States, hinterland/landlocked States, North-Eastern States, and UTs for the assessment of how well a State or UT has performed in comparison to the top State/UT within the specific cluster.\\nTaking a break from the past, states have not been ranked in order. This time, they have been \\nallotted three performance categories, namely, Achievers: States/UTs achieving a percentage score of 90 per cent or more, Fast Movers: States/UTs achieving percentage scores between 80 to 90 per cent, and Aspirers: States/UTs achieving percentage scores below 80 per cent. The results are indicated below.\\nUttar Pradesh Kerala Goa\\nTamil Nadu Sikkim Bihar\\nUttarakhand Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh\\nTelangana Tripura A&N Islands\\nPunjab Puducherry Mizoram\\nOdisha Rajasthan J&K\\nKarnataka Arunachal Pradhesh\\nHimachal Pradesh Ladakh\\nAssam Lakshadweep\\nDelhi Nagaland\\nChandigarh\\nHaryanaachievers fast Movers aspirers352\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nPM gatishakti: a master plan for integrated project planning\\n12.36 The growth experience of advanced economies has highlighted the importance of \\nhaving a multimodal transport network approach. Introducing the holistic planning in the case \\nof infrastructure projects, the government launched PM GatiShakti, charting a transformative approach to infrastructure development. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan entails creation of a common umbrella platform with all infrastructure projects pertaining to various ministries/ departments incorporated within a comprehensive database for efficient planning and implementation on a real-time basis. The projects pertaining to seven engines (roads, railways, \\nairports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistic infrastructure) in the NIP will be aligned \\nwith PM GatiShakti framework. The touchstone of the Master Plan will be high quality modern infrastructure and logistics synergy among different modes of movement – both of people and of goods – and location of projects. This will help raise productivity, and accelerate economic growth and development. \\n12.37  The focus is on integrated planning and synchronised implementation across ministries/\\ndepartments, with innovative use of technology. The aim is to improve multimodal connectivity \\nand logistics efficiency while addressing the critical gaps for the seamless movement of people and goods, with a focus on minimising disruptions and timely completion of infrastructure projects.\\n12.38 In order to facilitate integrated planning and coordinated implementation, a GIS-\\nbased and data-driven decision support platform called PM GatiShakti National Master Plan \\nhas been introduced. Around 1950 data layers of 22 ministries/departments and 36 States/UTs were mapped up to the village, district, and taluka levels on the national master plan. It can be integrated with various applications of different ministries/agencies to prevent duplication of work and create a single window system for infrastructure planning. Data layers on important assets pertaining to health, education, culture, tourism, gram panchayats, municipal corporation, social welfare housing etc. are being mapped and data validation is being done for optimum use of PM GatiShakti principles in planning of both physical and social infrastructures. Use cases of GatiShakti National Master Plan include connectivity to model schools and disaster management planning etc.\\ndevelopments in Physical infrastructure sectors\\nroad transport: increased budgetary support by the government augmented road  \\nconnectivity\\n12.39 Road infrastructure in the form of a network of national highways, state highways, district \\nroads, rural roads, and urban roads acts as a major mode of transportation and connectivity for the country’s diverse population of consumers and businesses. Roads supplement the other modes of transport through last-mile connectivity to the far-flung regions of the country.  \\n12.40 There has been an increase in the construction of National Highways (NHs)/roads over \\ntime, with 10,457 km of roads constructed in FY22 as compared to 6,061 km in FY16. In FY23 \\n(until October 2022), 4,060 km of NHs/roads were constructed, which was around 91 per cent of the achievement in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. Total budgetary support for investment in the sector has been increasing rapidly in the last four years and stood at around ₹1.4 lakh crore during FY23 (as of 31 October 2022).353\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\n12.41 In line with the vision of monetisation of public sector assets, National Highways \\nAuthority of India (NHAI) launched its InvIT in FY22 not only to facilitate monetisation of \\nroads but also to attract foreign and domestic institutional investors to invest in the roads sector.

The \\nIndian Railways (IR), with over 68,031 route kms, is the fourth largest network in the world under single management. Passenger traffic originating in IR was 809 crore during pre-Covid-19 period (2019-20), but dipped to 125 crore in 2020-21. It has since recovered to 351.9 crore in 2021-22. During the current financial year, passenger traffic has seen further strong growth with the number of originating passengers already hitting 418.4 crore (up to November 2022).

This is further supported by the government through schemes such as UDAN, which has considerably enhanced regional connectivity through the opening of airports in India’s hinterland. Under this scheme, the government has approved a budget of ₹4500 crore for revival of existing unserved/ underserved airports/airstrips of the State governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), public sector undertakings and civil enclaves. The government has also accorded \\'in-principle\\' approval for the setting up of 21 greenfield airports across the country. More than one crore air passengers have availed themselves of the benefit of the UDAN scheme since its inception. The scheme focuses on the connectivity between the Tier-2 and 3 cities in the country and the number of beneficiaries will increase manifold as the connectivity improves between unserved and underserved airports.\\nPorts: handling higher capacity with governance reforms\\n12.48 For ages, the sea has been the source of opportunity and seashores have acted as the \\ngateways to prosperity for India. The development of ports is crucial for the economy, given that 357\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nmost of the international trade is handled through ports (around 90 per cent of international trade \\ncargo by volume and 79.9 per cent by value). The capacity of major ports, which was 871.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) at the end of March 2014, has increased to 1534.9 MTPA by the end of March 2022. Cumulatively they handled 720.1 MT traffic during FY22.\\n12.49 To meet the ever-increasing trade requirements, the expansion of port capacity has been \\naccorded the highest priority by the government through the implementation of well-conceived \\ninfrastructure development projects. To further enhance their efficiency, the government is focusing on improving port governance, addressing low-capacity utilisation, modernising berths with techno efficient loading/unloading equipment, and creating new channels for port connectivity. For streamlining the port compliances and for reducing the Turn Around Time for (TAT) for vessels, long strides have been taken at the major ports towards the digitisation of key EXIM processes. The Port Community System (PCS 1x) has digitised processes such as Electronic Invoice (e-Invoice), Electronic Payment (e-Payment) and Electronic Delivery Order (e-DO) for the physical release of cargo by custodians, in addition to the processes of generating electronic Bill of Lading (e-BL) and Letter of Credit (LC). Further, the Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) solution has been implemented at all major ports to enable seamless movement of traffic across port gates, including substantial reductions in documentation checks. Additionally, the process to bootstrap PCS 1x into National Logistics Portal-Marine (NLP-Marine) is already under way which will act as a Unified Digital Platform for all maritime stakeholders. \\ninland water transport: tapping the potential of navigable waterways\\n12.50 Inland water transport holds great untapped potential as a means for the transportation of \\ngoods and passengers. India has a large endowment of rivers, canals, and other waterways. The total navigable length of waterways in India is around 14,850 kilometres. \\nfigure Xii.9: navigable length of waterways in different states\\n 050010001500200025003000350040004500\\nWest Bengal\\nAssam\\nKerala\\nOdisha\\nKarnataka\\nAndhra Pradesh\\nBihar\\nMaharashtra\\nUttar Pradesh **\\nNagaland\\nGoa\\nTamil NaduKilometres\\nSource: Statistics of Inland Water Transport 2020-21, Ministry of Port, Shipping and Waterways\\nNote: Data pertains to 2020-21. **Data for Uttar Pradesh pertains to 2016-17358\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n12.51 Under the National Waterways Act 2016, 106 new waterways have been declared as \\nNational Waterways (NWs), taking the total number of NWs in the country to 111. Based on the \\noutcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), 26 NWs viable for cargo movement have been prioritised, out of which developmental activities have been initiated in the 14 most viable NWs. Further, to promote the use of inland waterways, waterway usage charges levied by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) on vessels moving on NWs were waived in July 2020, initially for a period of three years. The cargo movement on National Waterways achieved an all-time high of 108.8 million tons during FY22, recording 30.1 per cent growth compared to the previous year.\\n12.52 The Inland Vessels Bill 2021, which replaced the over 100 year-old Inland Vessels Act, \\n1917 (Act No.1 of 1917), was passed by the Parliament in August 2021. This will usher in a new \\nera for inland water transport sector and fulfil the vision to utilise the potential of multi-modal transport ecosystem while making the legislative framework user-friendly and promoting ease of doing business. The uniform application of rules and regulations will ensure seamless, quick, and cost-efficient trade and transportation by inland vessels using the inland waterways. Various sections of this Act as detailed in the box below have come into force in 2022. \\nBox Xii.3: inland Vessels act 2021\\nThe Inland Vessels Act of 1917, which had undergone several amendments, had provisions for the restrictive movement of mechanically propelled vessels and non-uniform standards and regulations across different states. The Inland Vessels Act 2021, which replaced the erstwhile Act, aims to bring uniformity in the application of the law relating to inland waterways and navigation within the country. Some salient features of the Act include:\\n State governments may declare by notification any inland water area as a “Zone” depending on the maximum significant wave height criteria as prescribed in the Act. Any mechanically propelled vessel would have to obtain a certificate, which would indicate the zone in which the vessel is to be operated.\\n A central database of inland vessels would be maintained by the government.\\n The standards for qualification, training, training institutes, examination, and grant of certificate of competency would be prescribed by the Central Government.\\n Standards for prevention of environmental pollution.\\n Constitution of a Development Fund by the State Government to be utilised for meeting emergency preparedness, containment of pollution, removal of unidentified wrecks or obstruction, boosting development works of inland water navigation, etc.\\nOverall, the new Act would lead to uniformity of rules across states ensuring unhindered and safe movement of vessels within and across states. This is likely to promote inland water transport as a potential mode for large-scale movement of cargo as well as passengers across the country owing to its relative cost effectiveness. 359\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nelectricity: installed capacity growth driven by renewables\\n12.53 The total installed power capacity of utilities and captive power plants (industries having \\ndemand of 1 Mega Watt (MW) and above) was 482.2 GW on 31 March 2022 as compared to \\n460.7 GW on 31 March 2021, up by 4.7 per cent.

There has been a gradual transition in India’s energy sector from the conventional sources to the non-fossil fuel sources. India is steadfast in its commitments towards non-fossil fuel-based energy resources. India has put in place a target of achieving 50 per cent cumulative installed capacity for generating electric power from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. India is well on its way to fulfilling its commitments with the share of renewables in overall installed capacity growing at a fast pace. This is a result of the various government initiatives aimed at supporting the renewable energy sector.\\ntable Xii.3: all india gross electricity generation Mode-w ise (gwh)\\nhydro thermal nuclear renewables total\\n2020-21 1.5 12.5 0.4 1.5 15.9\\n2021-22@ 1.5 13.4 0.4 1.7 17.2\\nGrowth (in\\n per cent)0.9 7.3 9.5 16.2 7.6\\nSource: Ministry of Power. \\nNote: @ Estimated\\n12.55 Government of India has been driving a vibrant renewable energy programme aimed at \\nachieving energy security and energy access, and reducing the carbon footprints of the national \\neconomy.

In this regard, Indian Railways has \\nreoriented its energy demand towards greater use of renewable sources. As of November 2022, plants generating about 143 MW of solar power (both on rooftops and on land) and about 103 MW of wind power have been commissioned. \\n12.57 Other important incentives for renewable power generation include Hydropower \\nPurchase Obligation (HPO) within Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO). With \\nthe government support, the private sector has actively participated in boosting the overall generation capacity and bringing down unit costs over a short period.\\ndevelopments in digital infrastructure\\n12.58 While the role of traditional infrastructure has been well recognised, in recent years, \\nthe role of digital infrastructure in socio-economic development of the country has assumed an increased importance. This was especially true during the Covid-19 period when the curtailment of physical interactions necessitated the utilisation of digital infrastructure already available for service delivery and remote work. In the coming years, the availability and spread of digital infrastructure will contribute significantly to economic growth. Recognising this, the government’s Digital India programme, which aims to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy, envisions digital infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen. The focus areas include the availability of high-speed internet as a core utility for delivery of services to citizens, unique digital identity, enabling citizen participation in digital and financial space, shareable private space on a public cloud (citizens can digitally store their documents, certificates, etc. and share them with public agencies or others without the need to physically submit them), and a safe and secure cyber-space. Some developments in the digital infrastructure sphere are detailed below.\\nTelecommunications: Accelerating provision of affordable services\\n12.59 As a result of the persistent efforts made by the government towards promoting  \\ntechnological development, telecommunications services have penetrated the remotest corners of the nation. The country has come a long way from the days when a telephone connection was seen as a luxury to the present where a majority of people have a mobile connection. This was due to a cumulative effort of telecom players who widened their network bandwidth, government’s enabling environment and consumers’ outreach for smartphones. Today, the total telephone subscriber base in India stands at 117 crore (as of November 2022). While more than 97 per cent of the total subscribers are connected wirelessly (114.3 crore at the end of November 2022), 83.7 crore have internet connections as of June 2022. The overall tele-density in India stood at 84.8 per cent, with wide differences across states. It ranged from 55.4 per cent in Bihar to 270.6 per cent in Delhi. Eight license service areas, namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, 361\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nHimachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka had a tele-density of above 100 \\nper cent.\\nfigure Xii.10: overall tele density, license service area wise\\n 050100150200250300\\nAndhra Pradesh\\nAssam\\nBihar\\nGujarat\\nHaryana\\nHimachal Pradesh\\nJammu & Kashmir\\nKarnataka\\nKerala\\nMadhya Pradesh\\nMaharashtra\\nNort h East\\nOdisha\\nPunjab\\nRajasthan\\nTamil Nadu\\nUttar Pradesh (East+West)\\nWest Bengal\\nKolkata\\nDelhi\\nMumbaiteledensity (per cent)\\nSource: Department of Telecommunications\\n12.60 Apart from the interstate disparity in tele-density, in rural areas the tele-density continues \\nto be at much lower levels compared to urban areas. However, the catch-up by the rural areas \\nis heartening as the YoY change in internet subscribers is greater in rural (for the majority of the states) than in urban areas. This provided a cushion to the rural economy during the initial phase of the Covid-19 as many people went back to rural India for their livelihood. The digital infrastructure created over the years ensured not just the continuous transmission of information but also added economic value when businesses went digital.\\nBox Xii.4: lessening the rural-urban digital divide\\nConverting the crisis into opportunity, India, through its resilient measures, has been able to contain the impact of the pandemic through structural reforms in several sectors, telecom being one of them. During the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic, the telecommunication sector continued to provide seamless connectivity for the smooth functioning of critical activities and services such as ‘work from home’, ‘study from home’ etc. This was supported by the significant increase in affordable smartphones, which became more than a communication device. It emerged as the key enabler of Digital India initiative with various new services and applications like digital payments, e-governance, e-commerce, e-health, and e-education. Acting as the backbone, these services have boosted the overall economic growth of the country. \\nBefore 2014, access to digital services was perceived as a prerogative of urban households. 362\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nThis was substantiated by the then-existing digital divide seen from tele density (number of \\nsubscribers per 100 inhabitants) in rural and urban areas being 44.01 and 145.46 respectively in 2014. However, with the vision of developing digital infrastructure as a core utility for every citizen, Digital India as an umbrella programme was launched in 2015. Service delivery through digital tools has travelled a long way since then. We have added more internet subscribers in rural areas in the last 3 years (2019-21) than in their urban counterparts (95.76 million vis-a-vis 92.81 million in rural and urban areas respectively). This has been a result of dedicated digital drives across rural areas through ambitious government schemes, like the flagship BharatNet Project Scheme, Telecom Development Plan,  Aspirational District Scheme, initiatives in North-Eastern Region through Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP) and initiatives towards areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE)etc.\\nfigure: lsa  wise difference in rural growth (per cent) over urban growth (per cent) in \\ninternet subscribers\\n -250-200-150-100-50050100150\\nAndhra Pradesh\\nAssam\\nBihar\\nDelhi\\nGujarat\\nHaryana\\nHimachal Pradesh\\nJammu & Kashmir\\nKarnataka\\nKerala\\nKolkata\\nMadhya Pradesh\\nMaharashtra\\nMumbai\\nNort h East\\nOrissa\\nPunjab\\nRajasthan\\nTamil Nadu\\nUP (East)\\nUP (West)\\nWest Bengalper cent\\n2018 2019 2020 2021\\nThis concrete focus on bridging the gap between rural and urban internet penetration has borne positive results. The plot of the difference in the growth rates (per cent) of internet subscribers in rural over urban areas is somewhat volatile across states and years. The steep transition from a negative gap in 2018 for most LSAs to above 50 per cent in positive territory (for a majority of LSAs) in 2019 reflects the demand side growth in digital services, which was backed by the availability of budget smartphones and affordable data usage. The difference has been positive since then. \\nThis significant growth in rural India was the major shock absorber during the COVID-19 \\npandemic when both businesses and consumer demand were impacted. When majority of the workforce reverse-migrated to rural areas in search of livelihoods, agriculture (3.4 per cent growth in FY20-21) as well as the world’s largest employment scheme MNREGA supported the domestic economy. The digital infrastructure created over the years in rural areas ensured transparent and timely payments to the beneficiaries directly into their account thus limiting their exposure to the virus. With affordability and accessibility to private education restricted, 12\\n12 per cent change in Rural subscriptions -  per cent change in Urban subscriptions.363\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nthe digital support system in government schools absorbed the then much-needed enrolment \\nto counter the learning gap. As schooling went online for a considerable period even post-pandemic, the increase in internet subscriptions in rural areas helped mitigate learning loss significantly. This even facilitated the successful rollout of mass vaccination in rural areas.\\nThe 200 per cent increase in rural internet subscriptions between 2015 and 2021 vis-a-vis \\n158 per cent in urban areas, reflects the increased impetus the government is putting to bring rural and urban digital connectivity to the same level. For further widening the net, to include unconnected areas and populations, dedicated long-term efforts by the government have been taken. Government Schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for telecom and networking products will promote domestic mobile manufacturing as well as network installation. Continuous proliferation of measures such as Bharat Net Project shall continue to improve accessibility, affordability, connectivity, and inclusivity pan-India. This in turn will help in realizing the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister to digitally empower every Indian, as we march towards India’s ‘Techade’.\\n12.61 To further create digital linkages at the grassroots level and increase the consumer \\nexperience like the one in urban centres, a project for the saturation of 4G mobile services in uncovered villages across the country has been approved. The project will provide 4G mobile services in 24,680 uncovered villages in remote and difficult areas, and 6,279 villages having only 2G/3G connectivity shall be upgraded to 4G. \\n12.62 With a special focus on the states in the North-Eastern Region, the government is \\nimplementing a Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP). Under CTDP for NER, \\nmobile connectivity on 2G is to be provided by setting up 2004 towers in the uncovered villages and along National Highways of Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh (National Highways only). As of 25 October 2021, 1,358 towers have been installed and they are operational. In addition, other projects on providing 4G mobile coverage to uncovered villages in Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and two districts of Assam (Karbi Anglong & Dima Hasao) are under way. Furthermore, to make available high-quality and high-speed internet access to the states of the North-Eastern Region of the country, Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) signed an Agreement with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) on 18 August 2021 for the hiring of 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) International Bandwidth for Internet Connectivity to Agartala from Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited (BSCCL), Bangladesh. The first 10 Gbps link was commissioned on 26 November 2021, and the second 10 Gbps link on 21 April 2022.\\n12.63 When telecom is spanning coastlines, forests, and even deserts why should islands \\nbe left behind? A comprehensive initiative to connect our islands to the mainland has been \\nrealised through the government’s initiative of the Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan for Islands. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Chennai to Andaman & Nicobar Islands (CANI) project was launched to connect Port Blair and seven other islands of Andaman & Nicobar Islands with Chennai through 2,313 km of underwater OFC. There has been an immense 364\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nproliferation of bandwidth utilisation, almost 30 times, from 2.7Gbps to 75.7Gbps. The project \\nhas led to an FTTH speed of 100 Mbps, and up to 15 times more data volume is available now. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Kochi to Lakshadweep Islands (KLI) project was launched to connect Kochi with Kavaratti and ten other islands of Lakshadweep through 1869 kms of underwater OFC project, and the project is likely to be completed by May 2023. The project is currently under way and will ensure digital inclusion across the islands and is expected to trigger significant transformation across all sectors, including agriculture, tourism, health, and education.\\n12.64 A landmark achievement in telecommunications in India was the launch of 5G services. \\n5G could impact consumers directly through higher data transfer speeds and lower latency. 5G \\nuse cases developed by Telecom Service Providers and start-ups in education, health, worker safety, smart agriculture etc., are now being deployed across the country. Telecom reforms and clear policy direction led to the spectrum auction of 2022 garnering the highest-ever bids.\\n12.65 As a major reform measure, the Indian Telegraph Right of Way (Amendment) Rules, \\n2022, will facilitate faster and easier deployment of telegraph infrastructure to enable speedy \\n5G rollout. The government has brought in procedural reforms in Wireless Licensing, including delicensing of various frequency bands to promote innovation, manufacturing and export. The National Frequency Allocation Plan 2022 (NFAP) provides a broad regulatory framework, identifying which frequency bands are available for cellular mobile services, Wi-fi, sound and television broadcasting, radio navigation for aircraft and ships, and other wireless communications. NFAP will give guidance to the users of the spectrum to plan their networks in accordance with the relevant frequency and parameters provided therein. Given that spectrum is a scarce resource, NFAP is useful in aligning spectrum usage with demands from emerging technologies in an efficient manner.\\n12.66 To propel growth and to accelerate the provisioning of affordable services to the citizens \\nin the fast-emerging area of satellite-based services, reforms have been undertaken to promote \\nease of doing business by limiting the multiplicity of charges at different stages of rolling out satellite-based communication services. To simplify the existing processes, vital changes have also been carried out to streamline satellite-related clearance processes.\\n12.67 Universal and equitable access to broadband services across the country, especially in \\nrural areas, is an important part of the government’s vision for national digital connectivity. \\nToward realising that vision, the GatiShakti Sanchar portal was launched on 14 May 2022. This portal will streamline the process of Right of Way (RoW) applications and permissions across the country. The portal has been developed keeping in view the vision areas of the National Broadband Mission at the core, which are providing broadband infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen, governance and services on demand and in particular, digital empowerment of the citizens of our country. \\n12.68 Now, having discussed telecom at length, the next digital story which rings in our ears is \\nradio which has been one of the best media to reach all residents of the country.365\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nBox Xii.5: radio - the waves that connected ..!!\\nIn today’s fast-moving social media age, it is noteworthy how one of the components of mass \\nmedia, namely the radio has not only persisted as the bulwark for outreach during the times of pandemic and beyond but in this fast-evolving digital era has also embossed a separate identity of its own in the hearts of many. Radio continues to be the most affordable and popular medium of mass communication in India and has been a tool that has consistently helped in empowerment and social development of the people of our country. The accessibility, wide coverage, variety of programmes, mobility and vernacularity have continued to be reasons for its popularity. For instance, the popular ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme where the Prime Minister establishes a dialogue with the citizens on issues of day-to-day governance reached the milestone of completing its 96th episode on 25th December 2022, with more to follow this year. \\nThe iconic line “This is All India Radio. The news read by...” rings in our ears as we reminisce how \\nPrasar Bharati, India\\'s autonomous public service broadcaster, has not only been witness to the history and landmark events of the country, but has also been the proverbial story-teller for all citizens across the country, standing by its motto ‘Bahujan Hitaya: Bahujan Sukhaya’, meaning \\'for the happiness of many, for the welfare of many\\'. It broadcasts in 23 languages, 179 dialects from 479 stations across the country, reaching nearly 92 per cent of the area and 99.2 per cent of the total population of the country. Prasar Bharati marked its silver jubilee on 23 November 2022, and it is notable how it has embraced technology, reflected in the fact that over 240 radio services of All India Radio are live-streamed on NewsOnAir App, Prasar Bharati’s official App. These streams have a large number of listeners not just in India, but globally, in more than 85 countries across the world. \\nAlong with the public broadcaster, private commercial radio stations (FM Radio) and \\nCommunity Radio Stations (CRS) each serve as platforms for a variety of programmes. FM Radio has flourished in the last few years, as observed in the quarterly growth in private FM Radio stations, with their number increasing from 243 in the quarter ending December 2015 to 388 in quarter ending June 2022\\n13.\\n 200220240260280300320340360380400\\nDec-15\\nMar-16\\nJun-16\\nSep-16\\nDec-16\\nMar-17\\nJun-17\\nSep-17\\nDec-17\\nMar-18\\nJun-18\\nSep-18\\nDec-18\\nMar-19\\nJun-19\\nSep-19\\nDec-19\\nMar-20\\nJun-20\\nSep-20\\nDec-20\\nMar-21\\nJun-21\\nSep-21\\nDec-21\\nMar-22\\nJun-22Increase in number of FM radio stations366\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nThe rising number of FM radio stations depicts how radio as mass media has satisfactorily \\ndelivered on their mandate of public service and stood strong with the people during the time of the pandemic. While FM increased its outreach to even far-flung rural areas, CRS targeted local and well-defined communities. The daunting task of spreading awareness on the pandemic, and that too in vernacular, with innumerable dialects, was made possible, as CRS channelized the community partnerships. In times when the reach of centralized media to every nook and corner of the country was a gargantuan task, these radio waves travelled without interruption for the larger public cause. They not only became a medium for information dissemination but also functioned as a channel for empowerment as virtual education also took the recourse of radio. \\nWith this, we see the radio as being significantly important through good and tough times. As \\nwe operate in a new normal and as things settle down with time, these small boxes requiring manual tuning may again find their place in some household cupboards. However, their identity will remain intact. It will once again come to the fore to speak for itself with the iconic line “This is All India Radio. The news read by...”.\\ngrowth story of digital Public infrastructure\\n12.69 The emergence of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), aimed at improving financial \\nliteracy, innovation, entrepreneurship, employment generation, and empowering beneficiaries has played a critical role in uplifting the economy and bringing it to the stature where it stands today. The journey of DPI has been remarkably memorable, dating to 2009, when Aadhaar was first launched. It is fourteen years now, and the digital journey since then has taken the country quite far. The three growth drivers that acted as catalysts for DPI growth were favourable demographics, vast expansion of the middle-class, and digital behaviour patterns. By leveraging these growth drivers, India has built a competitive digital economy that empowers every individual and business to transact paperless and cashless.\\n12.70 With Aadhaar establishing the authentication framework for verifying the identity of \\nbeneficiaries of welfare schemes, the next logical step was to make major government services \\navailable digitally. However, a lack of knowledge about the existing schemes was seen as a primary reason behind the beneficiaries’ inability to access the schemes’ benefits. ‘MyScheme’ is an e-Marketplace for schemes where users can look for suitable schemes based on their eligibility. It helps reduce users\\' time and effort by doing away with the requirement of searching multiple websites of government departments and studying multiple scheme guidelines to check their eligibility. The scheme also acts as the single national platform for launching any government scheme. As on 16 January, 2023, more than 181 Central and State/UT government schemes across 14 diverse categories have been hosted on the portal.\\n13 Data sourced from quarterly Performance Indicator Reports by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India)367\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nfigure Xii.11: Myscheme portal provides information on schemes in three easy steps\\n \\n Source: https://www.myscheme.gov.in/, accessed on 3rd January 2023.\\n12.71 To reduce the search cost for the commoners, the government launched Unified \\nMobile Application for New-Age Governance (UMANG), which enables citizens to access \\ne-Government services offered by the Central and State Government in various sectors such as agriculture, education, health, housing, employees, pensioners, and students’ welfare, the Public Distribution System, and others. Until 16 January 2023, UMANG catered to about 21,869 services (1,672 Central and State Govt. services and 20197 Bill Payment services) under 310+ departments of Central Government and departments of 34 States/UTs. Over 4.9 crore users are registered and benefiting from services on UMANG. Four hundred and eighty-nine DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes were made live on UMANG until September 2022. During the trying times of Covid-19, UMANG was instrumental in making available the services of EPFO for claims related to Covid-19. Around 4.9 lakh advance claims in EPFO have been raised via the UMANG Platform until September 2022. \\n12.72  While the initiatives mentioned above focused on bringing the government to the doorsteps \\nof the citizens, a unique initiative that deserves special mention is the Open Network for Digital \\nCommerce (ONDC). ONDC aims to go beyond the current platform-centric digital commerce model where the buyer and seller can use the same platform or application for transactions. ONDC is a network-based open protocol that would connect all the buyers and sellers on the network thus bringing better visibility across the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) & Business-to-Business (B2B) landscape. In the ONDC framework, consumers can potentially discover any seller, product, or service by using any compatible application or platform. This will increase the freedom of choice for the consumers and will enable them to match demand with the nearest available supply, allowing them to choose their preferred local businesses. ONDC’s beta test in the city of Bengaluru is a major first step in operationalising a network approach to e-commerce as an alternative to a platform-centric approach. The open network system will make the e-Commerce landscape more inclusive, accessible, and experience-driven for all consumers and sellers, especially for small businesses that will exercise more freedom in business decision-making.368\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\n12.73 The government is also cognizant of the need to improve the productivity of human \\ncapital. In order to promote open collaborative software development of e-governance \\napplications, a platform called OpenForge has been developed. Through OpenForge, the use of open-source software and sharing and reuse of e-governance-related source code is promoted. As on 16 January 2023, there are 10,328 users on the platform, with 2,205 projects\\n 14.  \\n12.74 Another important domain that the government has emphasised is the availability of \\nopen resources on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The national AI portal has been developed with a view to strengthening the AI ecosystem in the country by pooling together and highlighting the latest developments happening in Central and State Governments, industry, academia, NGOs, and civil societies. As on 16 January 2023, it has published 1724 articles, 829 news items, 276 videos, 127 research reports, and 120 government initiatives, all related to AI. \\n12.75 In a country such as India, with its unmatched linguistic and cultural diversity, AI has \\ngreat potential as a tool for overcoming the language barrier. ‘Bhashini’, the National Language \\nTranslation Mission, aiming at nurturing Indian language technologies and solutions as a public good, was launched in July 2022. The Digital India Bhashini portal\\n15 is a public digital platform \\non which 260 open-source API-based AI models are available for speech-to-text conversion, machine translation, and text-to-speech conversion in 11 Indian languages and English for various purposes. Bhashini has great potential to bring access to the internet and other digital resources to millions of Indians in their own languages. \\n12.76 The digital landscape is a fast-changing one with overarching technologies arriving at \\nthe doorstep of consumers and businesses. The third generation in web technologies, ‘Web \\n3.0’ is one such example where in the entire experience of the internet is changing in the way how it will be used, how websites are managed, and how internet services are provided. The horizons of internet use have broadened, and so has their deployment of better standards. The Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) is one such set of standards that is being hailed as a major shift in how lending and borrowing will be conducted in the future. This is another good initiative towards democratising lending operations and thus ensuring that small borrowers are able to avail themselves of the best terms under which credit is available. \\n12.77 Today, we have a powerful story on digital public infrastructure that is finding global \\nresonance. The increasing digital adoption during covid-19 in areas like healthcare, agriculture, \\nFinTech, education, and skilling indicates that the digital delivery of services in India has a massive potential across economic sectors. It is usually suggested that developing countries must follow global best practices. However, how India has created and harnessed its DPI is capturing the attention of many nations globally. Low-cost accessibility (Aadhaar), the success of citizen-centric services like Unified Payments Interface (UPI), large-scale adoption and reach (DigiLocker, MyGov), and the vaccine journey through Co-Win are important and successful milestones in India’s public digital infrastructure journey.\\n14 As per https://openforge.gov.in/ , last accessed 4 January 2023.\\n15 https://bhashini.gov.in369\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\nBox Xii.6: unified Payments interface - the game changer in real-time \\npayments!\\n‘I like how you’ve brought out the rising popularity of UPI. I laud my fellow Indians for \\nembracing digital payments! They’ve shown remarkable adaptability to tech and innovation’\\n                                                                                                shri narendra Modi, hon’ble PM \\nUnified Payments Interface (UPI) is a system that empowers and knits multiple bank accounts \\ninto a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund routing and merchant payments into one hood. It also caters to the “Peer to Peer” collection request, which can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience. \\nIntroduced in 2016 to revolutionize the payment landscape through universal operability, \\nsingle payment address, and low-cost mobile-first payment system, UPI has acted as a positive disruption towards enabling greater digital payments adoption in the country.  UPI is a single mobile application for accessing different bank accounts. It can be accessed on all major platforms, such as Android and iOS. As the application is user-friendly and fast, consumers and merchants have displayed a great affinity to digital technology, leading to rapid growth in this digital payment infrastructure. The journey of UPI has been fascinating. The number of banks that became part of the real-time payment system increased from 35 in December 2017 to more than 380 in December 2022. Though pre-existing payment modes such as debit cards, credit cards, National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) have grown over time, UPI has shown a quantum jump comparatively to become one of the preferred modes of payment. In this sense, the progress of UPI has been remarkable.\\nIn FY19, UPI accounted for 17 per cent of the country\\'s total 3,100 crore digital transactions. \\nThe next fiscal year saw UPI’s share rise to more than 27 per cent as it processed 1,250 crore transactions out of 4,600 crore digital transactions. In FY22, UPI accounted for 52 per cent of the total 8,840 crore financial digital transactions.\\nOn average, between FY19-22 (calendar year), growth in UPI-based transactions in value and \\nvolume terms have been 121 per cent and 115 per cent, respectively. Recently, in Dec 2022, UPI touched its highest-ever mark with 782 crore transactions worth ₹12.8 lakh crore.\\n \\n16183472126\\n01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,000\\n020406080100120140\\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\\ncrore₹ Lakh croreUPI transactions over the calendar years \\nValue(₹ Lakh crore) Volume (RHS)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003   Source: NPCI370\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nUPI also allows for multiple methods for integrating payments—QR based payments being \\nthe most popular. In just 5 years, over 23 crore UPI QRs have been deployed in the market for accepting merchant payments, from only 25 lakhs devices that were accepting merchant payments before this.\\nThe benefits of UPI became evident during the Covid-19 pandemic when UPI served as a \\ncritical lifeline, especially for small and micro merchants. Further, UPI has processed 2,922 crore contactless merchants’ transactions with a total value over ₹21.7 lakh crore in FY23 (till December 2022). \\nThe success of UPI has not been restricted to India alone; NPCI, through its international \\narm NPCIL is pushing for acceptance of RuPay/UPI powered apps, cross-border remittance and UPI-Like deployment in international markets such as Singapore, UAE, France, the Netherlands among others.\\nInitiative towards the discussion on cross-border remittances will help reduce the cost incurred \\nand procedures involved towards money transfer at present by the migrant workers. The smooth transfer of money will increase the total value of remittances, increasing their impact on economic development. NPCI has also succeeded in developing an exemplary robust payments system that is cost-effective, secure, convenient and instantaneous. Several nations have displayed an inclination towards establishing a ‘real-time payment system’ or ‘domestic card scheme’ inspired by the exemplary innovations by NPCI in the country.\\nTech companies are increasingly leveraging the power of UPI to expand the digital ecosystem, \\nwhich has led to a significant acceleration in the pace of financial inclusion. UPI has opened up many opportunities for start-ups and e-Commerce players to develop innovative solutions that elevate the customer experience. The open systems have enabled global players like Google, WhatsApp, Walmart, True Caller, Amazon, Uber etc., to provide UPI services.\\nIt is envisioned that the journey of UPI will help accelerate the process of financial inclusion \\nand digital adoption in India by creating a more prosperous and inclusive ecosystem that can accommodate larger sections of the population in times to come.\\n12.78 The introduction of GST, with its end-to-end digitisation of all processes, digitalisation \\nof tax administration, and the faceless e–assessment scheme for Income Tax, have improved governance and formalisation of the economy. The seamless generations of e-way bills and electronic toll collections have further augmented better tax collections for the government. It has not just helped in curbing tax evasion but generated trust for small businesses through monitoring compliance. \\n12.79 The government has also taken initiatives towards empowering individuals with control \\nover their data to access essential services related to finance, health, education, and skills digitally. \\nThe Account Aggregator (AA) is a global techno-legal framework that enables individuals to share their financial data quickly and securely, with their consent, with any regulated third-party financial institution of their choice. The AA framework is currently live across over 110 crore of bank accounts. 371\\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\\n12.80 Adding to the journey, FY15 can be considered a turning point for the Indian start-up \\nenvironment. The reforms led by our government, in addition to existing inherent advantages \\nlike demography, technological developments, entrepreneurial spirit, and market size, have changed the landscape of the start-up ecosystem in India. The year 2021 marked the completion of five years of the ‘Stand-up India’ scheme (launched in January 2016), and the numbers - with more than 84,000 recognized start-ups - tell the entire story.  Start-ups have moved past the traditional territory of consumer products and services to much larger value-added services such as satellites. \\n12.81 India is also geared to strengthen the up-and-coming drone industry. Under Mission    \\n\\'Drone Shakti\\', the drone start-ups and Drone-as-a-Service (DrAAS) are being promoted. Almost \\n90 per cent of the airspace has now been opened up as a green zone for flying drones up to 400 feet. A Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for drones and drone import policy have been notified. Also, the private equity investments in agri-tech space have skyrocketed over the past four years – witnessing an increase of more than 50 per cent per annum to aggregate approximately ₹6600 crore. \\n12.82 As our digital space widens to bring in newer services, the need for appropriate regulations \\nalso becomes paramount. Therefore, techno-smart regulations are the future for digital societies. \\nIn this regard, the governments worldwide have adopted or are introducing legislation to provide a foundation for robust data governance. Their policy goals can be complemented and advanced with the help of standard, open, and interoperable protocols that increase the choice of digital services available to a user and enhance user privacy, such as the Data Empowerment & Protection Architecture. \\nconclusion/outlook\\n12.83 Today, we are operating in the new normal where the global economy is still recovering \\nfrom the setback due to pandemic, and geo-political conflicts persist. India could effectively steer through the situation owing to its dedicated support to infrastructure creation through increased capex and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. This underpinned economic growth when the private sector was cautious in investing due to its balance sheet problems and uncertain demand outlook stemming from global shocks.\\n12.84 The targeted increase in investment is seen across all infrastructure sectors. To help \\nsustain the investment drive, NIP provided a forward-looking roadmap of investible projects. \\nFurther, PM GatiShakti has helped accelerate infrastructure development by integrating the seven engines (roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistic infrastructure) of growth. While traditional infrastructure sectors such as roads and railways have received a renewed push in recent years, sectors such as inland water transport and civil aviation, which have significant untapped potential, are also being encouraged sufficiently. Parallelly, the focus is also on improving coordination among different stakeholders and ministries. This will help resolve compliance issues and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments. \\n12.85 Besides, the reforms being undertaken in energy and power sector will help fast-track \\nIndia\\'s progress in the next 25 years. With a population of nearly 140 crore, India has a massive \\ndemand for energy from all sectors including primary, secondary and tertiary. Affordable and 372\\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\\nreliable availability of power is critical for India’s aspirations for the manufacturing sector to \\nbe fulfilled. Further, with the growing importance of clean energy, there has been a renewed push towards non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in the power sector. The government, along with the private sector, has progressively worked towards increasing the share of renewables. This will ensure a gradual but calibrated energy transition, meeting the country’s sustainability targets and giving primacy to its national developmental requirements. \\n12.86 With the advent of new technologies, we are witnessing new regulatory challenges. \\nTechnology and innovation are, per se, neither constructive nor destructive. The use cases \\npresent the positive aspects of technology and innovation. The government is committed to keeping pace with the digital landscape developments including those related to legislations and frameworks. While the digital journey started with Aadhaar as a medium for service delivery at the doorstep, UPI strengthened the digital payment infrastructure. With other initiatives like Co-WIN, e-RUPI, TReDS, Account Aggregators, ONDC, etc. at different stages of implementation, India has developed a unique and cogent digital story to tell.  The journey is ongoing and there is much untapped potential in India\\'s digital public infrastructure space.\\n12.87 In sum, the synergy between physical and digital infrastructure will be one of the defining \\nfeatures of India\\'s future growth story.')]"
